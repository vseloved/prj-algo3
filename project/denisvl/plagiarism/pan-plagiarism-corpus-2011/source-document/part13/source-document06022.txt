CROWN OF WILD OLIVE

THREE LECTURES ON

WORK, TRAFFIC AND WAR

PREFACE.

Twenty years ago, there was no lovelier piece of lowland scenery in South England, nor any
more pathetic in the world, by its expression of sweet human character and life, than that
immediately bordering on the sources of the Wandle, and including the lower moors of Addington,
and the villages of Beddington and Carshalton, with all their pools and streams. No clearer
or diviner waters ever sang with constant lips of the hand which 'giveth rain from heaven;'
no pastures ever lightened in spring time with more passionate blossoming; no sweeter homes
ever hallowed the heart of the passer-by with their pride of peaceful gladness--fain-hidden--yet
full-confessed. The place remains, or, until a few months ago, remained, nearly unchanged in
its larger features; but, with deliberate mind I say, that I have never seen anything so ghastly
in its inner tragic meaning,--not in Pisan Maremma--not by Campagna tomb,--not by the sand-isles
of the Torcellan shore,--as the slow stealing of aspects of reckless, indolent, animal neglect,
over the delicate sweetness of that English scene: nor is any blasphemy or impiety--any frantic
saying or godless thought--more appalling to me, using the best power of judgment I have to
discern its sense and scope, than the insolent defilings of those springs by the human herds
that drink of them. Just where the welling of stainless water, trembling and pure, like a body
of light, enters the pool of Carshalton, cutting itself a radiant channel down to the gravel,
through warp of feathery weeds, all waving, which it traverses with its deep threads of clearness,
like the chalcedony in moss-agate, starred here and there with white grenouillette; just in
the very rush and murmur of the first spreading currents, the human wretches of the place cast
their street and house foulness; heaps of dust and slime, and broken shreds of old metal, and
rags of putrid clothes; they having neither energy to cart it away, nor decency enough to dig
it into the ground, thus shed into the stream, to diffuse what venom of it will float and melt,
far away, in all places where God meant those waters to bring joy and health. And, in a little
pool, behind some houses farther in the village, where another spring rises, the shattered
stones of the well, and of the little fretted channel which was long ago built and traced for
it by gentler hands, lie scattered, each from each, under a ragged bank of mortar, and scoria;
and brick-layers' refuse, on one side, which the clean water nevertheless chastises to purity;
but it cannot conquer the dead earth beyond; and there, circled and coiled under festering
scum, the stagnant edge of the pool effaces itself into a slope of black slime, the accumulation
of indolent years. Half-a-dozen men, with one day's work, could cleanse those pools, and trim
the flowers about their banks, and make every breath of summer air above them rich with cool
balm; and every glittering wave medicinal, as if it ran, troubled of angels, from the porch
of Bethesda. But that day's work is never given, nor will be; nor will any joy be possible
to heart of man, for evermore, about those wells of English waters.

When I last left them, I walked up slowly through the back streets of Croydon, from the old
church to the hospital; and, just on the left, before coming up to the crossing of the High
Street, there was a new public-house built. And the front of it was built in so wise manner,
that a recess of two feet was left below its front windows, between them and the street-pavement--a
recess too narrow for any possible use (for even if it had been occupied by a seat, as in old
time it might have been, everybody walking along the street would have fallen over the legs
of the reposing wayfarers). But, by way of making this two feet depth of freehold land more
expressive of the dignity of an establishment for the sale of spirituous liquors, it was fenced
from the pavement by an imposing iron railing, having four or five spearheads to the yard of
it, and six feet high; containing as much iron and iron-work, indeed as could well be put into
the space; and by this stately arrangement, the little piece of dead ground within, between
wall and street, became a protective receptacle of refuse; cigar ends, and oyster shells, and
the like, such as an open-handed English street-populace habitually scatters from its presence,
and was thus left, unsweepable by any ordinary methods. Now the iron bars which, uselessly
(or in great degree worse than uselessly), enclosed this bit of ground, and made it pestilent,
represented a quantity of work which would have cleansed the Carshalton pools three times over;--of
work, partly cramped and deadly, in the mine; partly fierce[1] and exhaustive, at the furnace;
partly foolish and sedentary, of ill-taught students making bad designs: work from the beginning
to the last fruits of it, and in all the branches of it, venomous, deathful, and miserable.
Now, how did it come to pass that this work was done instead of the other; that the strength
and life of the English operative were spent in defiling ground, instead of redeeming it; and
in producing an entirely (in that place) valueless piece of metal, which can neither be eaten
nor breathed, instead of medicinal fresh air, and pure water?

There is but one reason for it, and at present a conclusive one,--that the capitalist can charge
per-centage on the work in the one case, and cannot in the other. If, having certain funds
for supporting labour at my disposal, I pay men merely to keep my ground in order, my money
is, in that function, spent once for all; but if I pay them to dig iron out of my ground, and
work it, and sell it, I can charge rent for the ground, and per-centage both on the manufacture
and the sale, and make my capital profitable in these three bye-ways. The greater part of the
profitable investment of capital, in the present day, is in operations of this kind, in which
the public is persuaded to buy something of no use to it, on production, or sale, of which,
the capitalist may charge per-centage; the said public remaining all the while under the persuasion
that the per-centages thus obtained are real national gains, whereas, they are merely filchings
out of partially light pockets, to swell heavy ones.

Thus, the Croydon publican buys the iron railing, to make himself more conspicuous to drunkards.
The public-housekeeper on the other side of the way presently buys another railing, to out-rail
him with. Both are, as to their relative attractiveness to customers of taste, just where they
were before; but they have lost the price of the railings; which they must either themselves
finally lose, or make their aforesaid customers of taste pay, by raising the price of their
beer, or adulterating it. Either the publicans, or their customers, are thus poorer by precisely
what the capitalist has gained; and the value of the work itself, meantime, has been lost to
the nation; the iron bars in that form and place being wholly useless. It is this mode of taxation
of the poor by the rich which is referred to in the text (page 31), in comparing the modern
acquisitive power of capital with that of the lance and sword; the only difference being that
the levy of black mail in old times was by force, and is now by cozening. The old rider and
reiver frankly quartered himself on the publican for the night; the modern one merely makes
his lance into an iron spike, and persuades his host to buy it. One comes as an open robber,
the other as a cheating pedlar; but the result, to the injured person's pocket, is absolutely
the same. Of course many useful industries mingle with, and disguise the useless ones; and
in the habits of energy aroused by the struggle, there is a certain direct good. It is far
better to spend four thousand pounds in making a good gun, and then to blow it to pieces, than
to pass life in idleness. Only do not let it be called 'political economy.' There is also a
confused notion in the minds of many persons, that the gathering of the property of the poor
into the hands of the rich does no ultimate harm; since, in whosesoever hands it may be, it
must be spent at last, and thus, they think, return to the poor again. This fallacy has been
again and again exposed; but grant the plea true, and the same apology may, of course, be made
for black mail, or any other form of robbery. It might be (though practically it never is)
as advantageous for the nation that the robber should have the spending of the money he extorts,
as that the person robbed should have spent it. But this is no excuse for the theft. If I were
to put a turnpike on the road where it passes my own gate, and endeavour to exact a shilling
from every passenger, the public would soon do away with my gate, without listening to any
plea on my part that 'it was as advantageous to them, in the end, that I should spend their
shillings, as that they themselves should.' But if, instead of out-facing them with a turnpike,
I can only persuade them to come in and buy stones, or old iron, or any other useless thing,
out of my ground, I may rob them to the same extent, and be, moreover, thanked as a public
benefactor, and promoter of commercial prosperity. And this main question for the poor of England--for
the poor of all countries--is wholly omitted in every common treatise on the subject of wealth.
Even by the labourers themselves, the operation of capital is regarded only in its effect on
their immediate interests; never in the far more terrific power of its appointment of the kind
and the object of labour. It matters little, ultimately, how much a labourer is paid for making
anything; but it matters fearfully what the thing is, which he is compelled to make. If his
labour is so ordered as to produce food, and fresh air, and fresh water, no matter that his
wages are low;--the food and fresh air and water will be at last there; and he will at last
get them. But if he is paid to destroy food and fresh air or to produce iron bars instead of
them,--the food and air will finally not be there, and he will not get them, to his great and
final inconvenience. So that, conclusively, in political as in household economy, the great
question is, not so much what money you have in your pocket, as what you will buy with it,
and do with it.

I have been long accustomed, as all men engaged in work of investigation must be, to hear my
statements laughed at for years, before they are examined or believed; and I am generally content
to wait the public's time. But it has not been without displeased surprise that I have found
myself totally unable, as yet, by any repetition, or illustration, to force this plain thought
into my readers' heads,--that the wealth of nations, as of men, consists in substance, not
in ciphers; and that the real good of all work, and of all commerce, depends on the final worth
of the thing you make, or get by it. This is a practical enough statement, one would think:
but the English public has been so possessed by its modern school of economists with the notion
that Business is always good, whether it be busy in mischief or in benefit; and that buying
and selling are always salutary, whatever the intrinsic worth of what you buy or sell,--that
it seems impossible to gain so much as a patient hearing for any inquiry respecting the substantial
result of our eager modern labours. I have never felt more checked by the sense of this impossibility
than in arranging the heads of the following three lectures, which, though delivered at considerable
intervals of time, and in different places, were not prepared without reference to each other.
Their connection would, however, have been made far more distinct, if I had not been prevented,
by what I feel to be another great difficulty in addressing English audiences, from enforcing,
with any decision, the common, and to me the most important, part of their subjects. I chiefly
desired (as I have just said) to question my hearers--operatives, merchants, and soldiers,
as to the ultimate meaning of the business they had in hand; and to know from them what they
expected or intended their manufacture to come to, their selling to come to, and their killing
to come to. That appeared the first point needing determination before I could speak to them
with any real utility or effect. 'You craftsmen--salesmen--swordsmen,--do but tell me clearly
what you want, then, if I can say anything to help you, I will; and if not, I will account
to you as I best may for my inability.' But in order to put this question into any terms, one
had first of all to face the difficulty just spoken of--to me for the present insuperable,--the
difficulty of knowing whether to address one's audience as believing, or not believing, in
any other world than this. For if you address any average modern English company as believing
in an Eternal life, and endeavour to draw any conclusions, from this assumed belief, as to
their present business, they will forthwith tell you that what you say is very beautiful, but
it is not practical. If, on the contrary, you frankly address them as unbelievers in Eternal
life, and try to draw any consequences from that unbelief,--they immediately hold you for an
accursed person, and shake off the dust from their feet at you. And the more I thought over
what I had got to say, the less I found I could say it, without some reference to this intangible
or intractable part of the subject. It made all the difference, in asserting any principle
of war, whether one assumed that a discharge of artillery would merely knead down a certain
quantity of red clay into a level line, as in a brick field; or whether, out of every separately
Christian-named portion of the ruinous heap, there went out, into the smoke and dead-fallen
air of battle, some astonished condition of soul, unwillingly released. It made all the difference,
in speaking of the possible range of commerce, whether one assumed that all bargains related
only to visible property--or whether property, for the present invisible, but nevertheless
real, was elsewhere purchasable on other terms. It made all the difference, in addressing a
body of men subject to considerable hardship, and having to find some way out of it--whether
one could confidentially say to them, 'My friends,--you have only to die, and all will be right;'
or whether one had any secret misgiving that such advice was more blessed to him that gave,
than to him that took it. And therefore the deliberate reader will find, throughout these lectures,
a hesitation in driving points home, and a pausing short of conclusions which he will feel
I would fain have come to; hesitation which arises wholly from this uncertainty of my hearers'
temper. For I do not now speak, nor have I ever spoken, since the time of my first forward
youth, in any proselyting temper, as desiring to persuade any one of what, in such matters,
I thought myself; but, whomsoever I venture to address, I take for the time his creed as I
find it; and endeavour to push it into such vital fruit as it seems capable of. Thus, it is
a creed with a great part of the existing English people, that they are in possession of a
book which tells them, straight from the lips of God all they ought to do, and need to know.
I have read that book, with as much care as most of them, for some forty years; and am thankful
that, on those who trust it, I can press its pleadings. My endeavour has been uniformly to
make them trust it more deeply than they do; trust it, not in their own favourite verses only,
but in the sum of all; trust it not as a fetish or talisman, which they are to be saved by
daily repetitions of; but as a Captain's order, to be heard and obeyed at their peril. I was
always encouraged by supposing my hearers to hold such belief. To these, if to any, I once
had hope of addressing, with acceptance, words which insisted on the guilt of pride, and the
futility of avarice; from these, if from any, I once expected ratification of a political economy,
which asserted that the life was more than the meat, and the body than raiment; and these,
it once seemed to me, I might ask without accusation or fanaticism, not merely in doctrine
of the lips, but in the bestowal of their heart's treasure, to separate themselves from the
crowd of whom it is written, 'After all these things do the Gentiles seek.'

It cannot, however, be assumed, with any semblance of reason, that a general audience is now
wholly, or even in majority, composed of these religious persons. A large portion must always
consist of men who admit no such creed; or who, at least, are inaccessible to appeals founded
on it. And as, with the so-called Christian, I desired to plead for honest declaration and
fulfilment of his belief in life,--with the so-called Infidel, I desired to plead for an honest
declaration and fulfilment of his belief in death. The dilemma is inevitable. Men must either
hereafter live, or hereafter die; fate may be bravely met, and conduct wisely ordered, on either
expectation; but never in hesitation between ungrasped hope, and unconfronted fear. We usually
believe in immortality, so far as to avoid preparation for death; and in mortality, so far
as to avoid preparation for anything after death. Whereas, a wise man will at least hold himself
prepared for one or other of two events, of which one or other is inevitable; and will have
all things in order, for his sleep, or in readiness, for his awakening.

Nor have we any right to call it an ignoble judgment, if he determine to put them in order,
as for sleep. A brave belief in life is indeed an enviable state of mind, but, as far as I
can discern, an unusual one. I know few Christians so convinced of the splendour of the rooms
in their Father's house, as to be happier when their friends are called to those mansions,
than they would have been if the Queen had sent for them to live at Court: nor has the Church's
most ardent 'desire to depart, and be with Christ,' ever cured it of the singular habit of
putting on mourning for every person summoned to such departure. On the contrary, a brave belief
in death has been assuredly held by many not ignoble persons, and it is a sign of the last
depravity in the Church itself, when it assumes that such a belief is inconsistent with either
purity of character, or energy of hand. The shortness of life is not, to any rational person,
a conclusive reason for wasting the space of it which may be granted him; nor does the anticipation
of death to-morrow suggest, to any one but a drunkard, the expediency of drunkenness to-day.
To teach that there is no device in the grave, may indeed make the deviceless person more contented
in his dulness; but it will make the deviser only more earnest in devising, nor is human conduct
likely, in every case, to be purer under the conviction that all its evil may in a moment be
pardoned, and all its wrong-doing in a moment redeemed; and that the sigh of repentance, which
purges the guilt of the past, will waft the soul into a felicity which forgets its pain,--than
it may be under the sterner, and to many not unwise minds, more probable, apprehension, that
'what a man soweth that shall he also reap'--or others reap,--when he, the living seed of pestilence,
walketh no more in darkness, but lies down therein.

But to men whose feebleness of sight, or bitterness of soul, or the offence given by the conduct
of those who claim higher hope, may have rendered this painful creed the only possible one,
there is an appeal to be made, more secure in its ground than any which can be addressed to
happier persons. I would fain, if I might offencelessly, have spoken to them as if none others
heard; and have said thus: Hear me, you dying men, who will soon be deaf for ever. For these
others, at your right hand and your left, who look forward to a state of infinite existence,
in which all their errors will be overruled, and all their faults forgiven; for these, who,
stained and blackened in the battle smoke of mortality, have but to dip themselves for an instant
in the font of death, and to rise renewed of plumage, as a dove that is covered with silver,
and her feathers like gold; for these, indeed, it may be permissible to waste their numbered
moments, through faith in a future of innumerable hours; to these, in their weakness, it may
be conceded that they should tamper with sin which can only bring forth fruit of righteousness,
and profit by the iniquity which, one day, will be remembered no more. In them, it may be no
sign of hardness of heart to neglect the poor, over whom they know their Master is watching;
and to leave those to perish temporarily, who cannot perish eternally. But, for you, there
is no such hope, and therefore no such excuse. This fate, which you ordain for the wretched,
you believe to be all their inheritance; you may crush them, before the moth, and they will
never rise to rebuke you;--their breath, which fails for lack of food, once expiring, will
never be recalled to whisper against you a word of accusing;--they and you, as you think, shall
lie down together in the dust, and the worms cover you;--and for them there shall be no consolation,
and on you no vengeance,--only the question murmured above your grave: 'Who shall repay him
what he hath done?' Is it therefore easier for you in your heart to inflict the sorrow for
which there is no remedy? Will you take, wantonly, this little all of his life from your poor
brother, and make his brief hours long to him with pain? Will you be readier to the injustice
which can never be redressed; and niggardly of mercy which you can bestow but once, and which,
refusing, you refuse for ever? I think better of you, even of the most selfish, than that you
would do this, well understood. And for yourselves, it seems to me, the question becomes not
less grave, in these curt limits. If your life were but a fever fit,--the madness of a night,
whose follies were all to be forgotten in the dawn, it might matter little how you fretted
away the sickly hours,--what toys you snatched at, or let fall,--what visions you followed
wistfully with the deceived eyes of sleepless phrenzy. Is the earth only an hospital? Play,
if you care to play, on the floor of the hospital dens. Knit its straw into what crowns please
you; gather the dust of it for treasure, and die rich in that, clutching at the black motes
in the air with your dying hands;--and yet, it may be well with you. But if this life be no
dream, and the world no hospital; if all the peace and power and joy you can ever win, must
be won now; and all fruit of victory gathered here, or never;--will you still, throughout the
puny totality of your life, weary yourselves in the fire for vanity? If there is no rest which
remaineth for you, is there none you might presently take? was this grass of the earth made
green for your shroud only, not for your bed? and can you never lie down upon it, but only
under it? The heathen, to whose creed you have returned, thought not so. They knew that life
brought its contest, but they expected from it also the crown of all contest: No proud one!
no jewelled circlet flaming through Heaven above the height of the unmerited throne; only some
few leaves of wild olive, cool to the tired brow, through a few years of peace. It should have
been of gold, they thought; but Jupiter was poor; this was the best the god could give them.
Seeking a greater than this, they had known it a mockery. Not in war, not in wealth, not in
tyranny, was there any happiness to be found for them--only in kindly peace, fruitful and free.
The wreath was to be of wild olive, mark you:--the tree that grows carelessly, tufting the
rocks with no vivid bloom, no verdure of branch; only with soft snow of blossom, and scarcely
fulfilled fruit, mixed with grey leaf and thornset stem; no fastening of diadem for you but
with such sharp embroidery! But this, such as it is, you may win while yet you live; type of
grey honour and sweet rest.[2] Free-heartedness, and graciousness, and undisturbed trust, and
requited love, and the sight of the peace of others, and the ministry to their pain;--these,
and the blue sky above you, and the sweet waters and flowers of the earth beneath; and mysteries
and presences, innumerable, of living things,--these may yet be here your riches; untormenting
and divine: serviceable for the life that now is nor, it may be, without promise of that which
is to come.

FOOTNOTES:

[1] 'A fearful occurrence took place a few days since, near Wolverhampton. Thomas Snape, aged
nineteen, was on duty as the "keeper" of a blast furnace at Deepfield, assisted by John Gardner,
aged eighteen, and Joseph Swift, aged thirty-seven. The furnace contained four tons of molten
iron, and an equal amount of cinders, and ought to have been run out at 7.30 P.M. But Snape
and his mates, engaged in talking and drinking, neglected their duty, and in the meantime,
the iron rose in the furnace until it reached a pipe wherein water was contained. Just as the
men had stripped, and were proceeding to tap the furnace, the water in the pipe, converted
into steam, burst down its front and let loose on them the molten metal, which instantaneously
consumed Gardner; Snape, terribly burnt, and mad with pain, leaped into the canal and then
ran home and fell dead on the threshold, Swift survived to reach the hospital, where he died too.

In further illustration of this matter, I beg the reader to look at the article on the 'Decay
of the English Race,' in the 'Pall-Mall Gazette' of April 17, of this year; and at the articles
on the 'Report of the Thames Commission,' in any journals of the same date.

THE CROWN OF WILD OLIVE.

LECTURE I.

WORK.

(Delivered before the Working Men's Institute, at Camberwell.)

My Friends,--I have not come among you to-night to endeavour to give you an entertaining lecture;
but to tell you a few plain facts, and ask you some plain, but necessary questions. I have
seen and known too much of the struggle for life among our labouring population, to feel at
ease, even under any circumstances, in inviting them to dwell on the trivialities of my own
studies; but, much more, as I meet to-night, for the first time, the members of a working Institute
established in the district in which I have passed the greater part of my life, I am desirous
that we should at once understand each other, on graver matters. I would fain tell you, with
what feelings, and with what hope, I regard this Institution, as one of many such, now happily
established throughout England, as well as in other countries;--Institutions which are preparing
the way for a great change in all the circumstances of industrial life; but of which the success
must wholly depend upon our clearly understanding the circumstances and necessary limits of
this change. No teacher can truly promote the cause of education, until he knows the conditions
of the life for which that education is to prepare his pupil. And the fact that he is called
upon to address you nominally, as a 'Working Class,' must compel him, if he is in any wise
earnest or thoughtful, to inquire in the outset, on what you yourselves suppose this class
distinction has been founded in the past, and must be founded in the future. The manner of
the amusement, and the matter of the teaching, which any of us can offer you, must depend wholly
on our first understanding from you, whether you think the distinction heretofore drawn between
working men and others, is truly or falsely founded. Do you accept it as it stands? do you
wish it to be modified? or do you think the object of education is to efface it, and make us
forget it for ever?

Let me make myself more distinctly understood. We call this--you and I--a 'Working Men's' Institute,
and our college in London, a 'Working Men's' College. Now, how do you consider that these several
institutes differ, or ought to differ, from 'idle men's' institutes and 'idle men's' colleges?
Or by what other word than 'idle' shall I distinguish those whom the happiest and wisest of
working men do not object to call the 'Upper Classes?' Are there really upper classes,--are
there lower? How much should they always be elevated, how much always depressed? And, gentlemen
and ladies--I pray those of you who are here to forgive me the offence there may be in what
I am going to say. It is not I who wish to say it. Bitter voices say it; voices of battle and
of famine through all the world, which must be heard some day, whoever keeps silence. Neither
is it to you specially that I say it. I am sure that most now present know their duties of
kindness, and fulfil them, better perhaps than I do mine. But I speak to you as representing
your whole class, which errs, I know, chiefly by thoughtlessness, but not therefore the less
terribly. Wilful error is limited by the will, but what limit is there to that of which we
are unconscious?

Bear with me, therefore, while I turn to these workmen, and ask them, also as representing
a great multitude, what they think the 'upper classes' are, and ought to be, in relation to
them. Answer, you workmen who are here, as you would among yourselves, frankly; and tell me
how you would have me call those classes. Am I to call them--would you think me right in calling
them--the idle classes? I think you would feel somewhat uneasy, and as if I were not treating
my subject honestly, or speaking from my heart, if I went on under the supposition that all
rich people were idle. You would be both unjust and unwise if you allowed me to say that;--not
less unjust than the rich people who say that all the poor are idle, and will never work if
they can help it, or more than they can help.

For indeed the fact is, that there are idle poor and idle rich; and there are busy poor and
busy rich. Many a beggar is as lazy as if he had ten thousand a year; and many a man of large
fortune is busier than his errand-boy, and never would think of stopping in the street to play
marbles. So that, in a large view, the distinction between workers and idlers, as between knaves
and honest men, runs through the very heart and innermost economies of men of all ranks and
in all positions. There is a working class--strong and happy--among both rich and poor; there
is an idle class--weak, wicked, and miserable--among both rich and poor. And the worst of the
misunderstandings arising between the two orders come of the unlucky fact that the wise of
one class habitually contemplate the foolish of the other. If the busy rich people watched
and rebuked the idle rich people, all would be right; and if the busy poor people watched and
rebuked the idle poor people, all would be right. But each class has a tendency to look for
the faults of the other. A hard-working man of property is particularly offended by an idle
beggar; and an orderly, but poor, workman is naturally intolerant of the licentious luxury
of the rich. And what is severe judgment in the minds of the just men of either class, becomes
fierce enmity in the unjust--but among the unjust only. None but the dissolute among the poor
look upon the rich as their natural enemies, or desire to pillage their houses and divide their
property. None but the dissolute among the rich speak in opprobrious terms of the vices and
follies of the poor.

There is, then, no class distinction between idle and industrious people; and I am going to-night
to speak only of the industrious. The idle people we will put out of our thoughts at once--they
are mere nuisances--what ought to be done with them, we'll talk of at another time. But there
are class distinctions, among the industrious themselves; tremendous distinctions, which rise
and fall to every degree in the infinite thermometer of human pain and of human power--distinctions
of high and low, of lost and won, to the whole reach of man's soul and body.

These separations we will study, and the laws of them, among energetic men only, who, whether
they work or whether they play, put their strength into the work, and their strength into the
game; being in the full sense of the word 'industrious,' one way or another--with a purpose,
or without. And these distinctions are mainly four:

I. Between those who work, and those who play.

II. Between those who produce the means of life, and those who consume them.

III. Between those who work with the head, and those who work with the hand.

IV. Between those who work wisely, and who work foolishly.

For easier memory, let us say we are going to oppose, in our examination.--

    I.   Work to play;
    II.  Production to consumption;
    III. Head to Hand; and,
    IV.  Sense to nonsense.

I. First, then, of the distinction between the classes who work and the classes who play. Of
course we must agree upon a definition of these terms,--work and play,--before going farther.
Now, roughly, not with vain subtlety of definition, but for plain use of the words, 'play'
is an exertion of body or mind, made to please ourselves, and with no determined end; and work
is a thing done because it ought to be done, and with a determined end. You play, as you call
it, at cricket, for instance. That is as hard work as anything else; but it amuses you, and
it has no result but the amusement. If it were done as an ordered form of exercise, for health's
sake, it would become work directly. So, in like manner, whatever we do to please ourselves,
and only for the sake of the pleasure, not for an ultimate object, is 'play,' the 'pleasing
thing,' not the useful thing. Play may be useful in a secondary sense (nothing is indeed more
useful or necessary); but the use of it depends on its being spontaneous.

Let us, then, enquire together what sort of games the playing class in England spend their
lives in playing at.

The first of all English games is making money. That is an all-absorbing game; and we knock
each other down oftener in playing at that than at foot-ball, or any other roughest sport;
and it is absolutely without purpose; no one who engages heartily in that game ever knows why.
Ask a great money-maker what he wants to do with his money--he never knows. He doesn't make
it to do anything with it. He gets it only that he may get it. 'What will you make of what
you have got?' you ask. 'Well, I'll get more,' he says. Just as, at cricket, you get more runs.
There's no use in the runs, but to get more of them than other people is the game. And there's
no use in the money, but to have more of it than other people is the game. So all that great
foul city of London there,--rattling, growling, smoking, stinking,--a ghastly heap of fermenting
brick-work, pouring out poison at every pore,--you fancy it is a city of work? Not a street
of it! It is a great city of play; very nasty play, and very hard play, but still play. It
is only Lord's cricket ground without the turf,--a huge billiard table without the cloth, and
with pockets as deep as the bottomless pit; but mainly a billiard table, after all.

Well, the first great English game is this playing at counters. It differs from the rest in
that it appears always to be producing money, while every other game is expensive. But it does
not always produce money. There's a great difference between 'winning' money and 'making' it;
a great difference between getting it out of another man's pocket into ours, or filling both.
Collecting money is by no means the same thing as making it; the tax-gatherer's house is not
the Mint; and much of the apparent gain (so called), in commerce, is only a form of taxation
on carriage or exchange.

Our next great English game, however, hunting and shooting, is costly altogether; and how much
we are fined for it annually in land, horses, gamekeepers, and game laws, and all else that
accompanies that beautiful and special English game, I will not endeavour to count now: but
note only that, except for exercise, this is not merely a useless game, but a deadly one, to
all connected with it. For through horse-racing, you get every form of what the higher classes
everywhere call 'Play,' in distinction from all other plays; that is--gambling; by no means
a beneficial or recreative game: and, through game-preserving, you get also some curious laying
out of ground; that beautiful arrangement of dwelling-house for man and beast, by which we
have grouse and black-cock--so many brace to the acre, and men and women--so many brace to
the garret. I often wonder what the angelic builders and surveyors--the angelic builders who
build the 'many mansions' up above there; and the angelic surveyors, who measured that four-square
city with their measuring reeds--I wonder what they think, or are supposed to think, of the
laying out of ground by this nation, which has set itself, as it seems, literally to accomplish,
word for word, or rather fact for word, in the persons of those poor whom its Master left to
represent him, what that Master said of himself--that foxes and birds had homes, but He none.

Then, next to the gentlemen's game of hunting, we must put the ladies' game of dressing. It
is not the cheapest of games. I saw a brooch at a jeweller's in Bond Street a fortnight ago,
not an inch wide, and without any singular jewel in it, yet worth 3,000l. And I wish I could
tell you what this 'play' costs, altogether, in England, France, and Russia annually. But it
is a pretty game, and on certain terms, I like it; nay, I don't see it played quite as much
as I would fain have it. You ladies like to lead the fashion:--by all means lead it--lead it
thoroughly, lead it far enough. Dress yourselves nicely, and dress everybody else nicely. Lead
the fashions for the poor first; make them look well, and you yourselves will look, in ways
of which you have now no conception, all the better. The fashions you have set for some time
among your peasantry are not pretty ones; their doublets are too irregularly slashed, and the
wind blows too frankly through them.

Then there are other games, wild enough, as I could show you if I had time.

There's playing at literature, and playing at art--very different, both, from working at literature,
or working at art, but I've no time to speak of these. I pass to the greatest of all--the play
of plays, the great gentlemen's game, which ladies like them best to play at,--the game of
War. It is entrancingly pleasant to the imagination; the facts of it, not always so pleasant.
We dress for it, however, more finely than for any other sport; and go out to it, not merely
in scarlet, as to hunt, but in scarlet and gold, and all manner of fine colours: of course
we could fight better in grey, and without feathers; but all nations have agreed that it is
good to be well dressed at this play. Then the bats and balls are very costly; our English
and French bats, with the balls and wickets, even those which we don't make any use of, costing,
I suppose, now about fifteen millions of money annually to each nation; all of which, you know
is paid for by hard labourer's work in the furrow and furnace. A costly game!--not to speak
of its consequences; I will say at present nothing of these. The mere immediate cost of all
these plays is what I want you to consider; they all cost deadly work somewhere, as many of
us know too well. The jewel-cutter, whose sight fails over the diamonds; the weaver, whose
arm fails over the web; the iron-forger, whose breath fails before the furnace--they know what
work is--they, who have all the work, and none of the play, except a kind they have named for
themselves down in the black north country, where 'play' means being laid up by sickness. It
is a pretty example for philologists, of varying dialect, this change in the sense of the word
'play,' as used in the black country of Birmingham, and the red and black country of Baden
Baden. Yes, gentlemen, and gentlewomen, of England, who think 'one moment unamused a misery,
not made for feeble man,' this is what you have brought the word 'play' to mean, in the heart
of merry England! You may have your fluting and piping; but there are sad children sitting
in the market-place, who indeed cannot say to you, 'We have piped unto you, and ye have not
danced:' but eternally shall say to you, 'We have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.'

This, then, is the first distinction between the 'upper and lower' classes. And this is one
which is by no means necessary; which indeed must, in process of good time, be by all honest
men's consent abolished. Men will be taught that an existence of play, sustained by the blood
of other creatures, is a good existence for gnats and sucking fish; but not for men: that neither
days, nor lives, can be made holy by doing nothing in them: that the best prayer at the beginning
of a day is that we may not lose its moments; and the best grace before meat, the consciousness
that we have justly earned our dinner. And when we have this much of plain Christianity preached
to us again, and enough respect for what we regard as inspiration, as not to think that 'Son,
go work to-day in my vineyard,' means 'Fool, go play to-day in my vineyard,' we shall all be
workers, in one way or another; and this much at least of the distinction between 'upper' and
'lower' forgotten.

II. I pass then to our second distinction; between the rich and poor, between Dives and Lazarus,--distinction
which exists more sternly, I suppose, in this day, than ever in the world, Pagan or Christian,
till now. I will put it sharply before you, to begin with, merely by reading two paragraphs
which I cut from two papers that lay on my breakfast table on the same morning, the 25th of
November, 1864. The piece about the rich Russian at Paris is commonplace enough, and stupid
besides (for fifteen francs,--12s. 6d.,--is nothing for a rich man to give for a couple of
peaches, out of season). Still, the two paragraphs printed on the same day are worth putting
side by side.

'Such a man is now here. He is a Russian, and, with your permission, we will call him Count
Teufelskine. In dress he is sublime; art is considered in that toilet, the harmony of colour
respected, the chiar' oscuro evident in well-selected contrast. In manners he is dignified--nay,
perhaps apathetic; nothing disturbs the placid serenity of that calm exterior. One day our
friend breakfasted chez Bignon. When the bill came he read, "Two peaches, 15f." He paid. "Peaches
scarce, I presume?" was his sole remark. "No, sir," replied the waiter, "but Teufelskines are."'
Telegraph, November 25, 1864.

'Yesterday morning, at eight o'clock, a woman, passing a dung heap in the stone yard near the
recently-erected alms-houses in Shadwell Gap, High Street, Shadwell, called the attention of
a Thames police-constable to a man in a sitting position on the dung heap, and said she was
afraid he was dead. Her fears proved to be true. The wretched creature appeared to have been
dead several hours. He had perished of cold and wet, and the rain had been beating down on
him all night. The deceased was a bone-picker. He was in the lowest stage of poverty, poorly
clad, and half-starved. The police had frequently driven him away from the stone yard, between
sunset and sunrise, and told him to go home. He selected a most desolate spot for his wretched
death. A penny and some bones were found in his pockets. The deceased was between fifty and
sixty years of age. Inspector Roberts, of the K division, has given directions for inquiries
to be made at the lodging-houses respecting the deceased, to ascertain his identity if possible.'--Morning
Post, November 25, 1864.

You have the separation thus in brief compass; and I want you to take notice of the 'a penny
and some bones were found in his pockets,' and to compare it with this third statement, from
the Telegraph of January 16th of this year:--

'Again, the dietary scale for adult and juvenile paupers was drawn up by the most conspicuous
political economists in England. It is low in quantity, but it is sufficient to support nature;
yet within ten years of the passing of the Poor Law Act, we heard of the paupers in the Andover
Union gnawing the scraps of putrid flesh and sucking the marrow from the bones of horses which
they were employed to crush.'

You see my reason for thinking that our Lazarus of Christianity has some advantage over the
Jewish one. Jewish Lazarus expected, or at least prayed, to be fed with crumbs from the rich
man's table; but our Lazarus is fed with crumbs from the dog's table.

Now this distinction between rich and poor rests on two bases. Within its proper limits, on
a basis which is lawful and everlastingly necessary; beyond them, on a basis unlawful, and
everlastingly corrupting the framework of society. The lawful basis of wealth is, that a man
who works should be paid the fair value of his work; and that if he does not choose to spend
it to-day, he should have free leave to keep it, and spend it to-morrow. Thus, an industrious
man working daily, and laying by daily, attains at last the possession of an accumulated sum
of wealth, to which he has absolute right. The idle person who will not work, and the wasteful
person who lays nothing by, at the end of the same time will be doubly poor--poor in possession,
and dissolute in moral habit; and he will then naturally covet the money which the other has
saved. And if he is then allowed to attack the other, and rob him of his well-earned wealth,
there is no more any motive for saving, or any reward for good conduct; and all society is
thereupon dissolved, or exists only in systems of rapine. Therefore the first necessity of
social life is the clearness of national conscience in enforcing the law--that he should keep
who has JUSTLY EARNED.

That law, I say, is the proper basis of distinction between rich and poor. But there is also
a false basis of distinction; namely, the power held over those who earn wealth by those who
levy or exact it. There will be always a number of men who would fain set themselves to the
accumulation of wealth as the sole object of their lives. Necessarily, that class of men is
an uneducated class, inferior in intellect, and more or less cowardly. It is physically impossible
for a well-educated, intellectual, or brave man to make money the chief object of his thoughts;
as physically impossible as it is for him to make his dinner the principal object of them.
All healthy people like their dinners, but their dinner is not the main object of their lives.
So all healthily minded people like making money--ought to like it, and to enjoy the sensation
of winning it; but the main object of their life is not money; it is something better than
money. A good soldier, for instance, mainly wishes to do his fighting well. He is glad of his
pay--very properly so, and justly grumbles when you keep him ten years without it--still, his
main notion of life is to win battles, not to be paid for winning them. So of clergymen. They
like pew-rents, and baptismal fees, of course; but yet, if they are brave and well educated,
the pew-rent is not the sole object of their lives, and the baptismal fee is not the sole purpose
of the baptism; the clergyman's object is essentially to baptize and preach, not to be paid
for preaching. So of doctors. They like fees no doubt,--ought to like them; yet if they are
brave and well educated, the entire object of their lives is not fees. They, on the whole,
desire to cure the sick; and,--if they are good doctors, and the choice were fairly put to
them,--would rather cure their patient, and lose their fee, than kill him, and get it. And
so with all other brave and rightly trained men; their work is first, their fee second--very
important always, but still second. But in every nation, as I said, there are a vast class
who are ill-educated, cowardly, and more or less stupid. And with these people, just as certainly
the fee is first, and the work second, as with brave people the work is first and the fee second.
And this is no small distinction. It is the whole distinction in a man; distinction between
life and death in him, between heaven and hell for him. You cannot serve two masters;--you
must serve one or other. If your work is first with you, and your fee second, work is your
master, and the lord of work, who is God. But if your fee is first with you, and your work
second, fee is your master, and the lord of fee, who is the Devil; and not only the Devil,
but the lowest of devils--the 'least erected fiend that fell.' So there you have it in brief
terms; Work first--you are God's servants; Fee first--you are the Fiend's. And it makes a difference,
now and ever, believe me, whether you serve Him who has on His vesture and thigh written, 'King
of Kings,' and whose service is perfect freedom; or him on whose vesture and thigh the name
is written, 'Slave of Slaves,' and whose service is perfect slavery.

However, in every nation there are, and must always be, a certain number of these Fiend's servants,
who have it principally for the object of their lives to make money. They are always, as I
said, more or less stupid, and cannot conceive of anything else so nice as money. Stupidity
is always the basis of the Judas bargain. We do great injustice to Iscariot, in thinking him
wicked above all common wickedness. He was only a common money-lover, and, like all money-lovers,
didn't understand Christ;--couldn't make out the worth of Him, or meaning of Him. He didn't
want Him to be killed. He was horror-struck when he found that Christ would be killed; threw
his money away instantly, and hanged himself. How many of our present money-seekers, think
you, would have the grace to hang themselves, whoever was killed? But Judas was a common, selfish,
muddle-headed, pilfering fellow; his hand always in the bag of the poor, not caring for them.
He didn't understand Christ;--yet believed in Him, much more than most of us do; had seen Him
do miracles, thought He was quite strong enough to shift for Himself, and he, Judas, might
as well make his own little bye-perquisites out of the affair. Christ would come out of it
well enough, and he have his thirty pieces. Now, that is the money-seeker's idea, all over
the world. He doesn't hate Christ, but can't understand Him--doesn't care for him--sees no
good in that benevolent business; makes his own little job out of it at all events, come what
will. And thus, out of every mass of men, you have a certain number of bag-men--your 'fee-first'
men, whose main object is to make money. And they do make it--make it in all sorts of unfair
ways, chiefly by the weight and force of money itself, or what is called the power of capital;
that is to say, the power which money, once obtained, has over the labour of the poor, so that
the capitalist can take all its produce to himself, except the labourer's food. That is the
modern Judas's way of 'carrying the bag,' and 'bearing what is put therein.'

Nay, but (it is asked) how is that an unfair advantage? Has not the man who has worked for
the money a right to use it as he best can? No; in this respect, money is now exactly what
mountain promontories over public roads were in old times. The barons fought for them fairly:--the
strongest and cunningest got them; then fortified them, and made everyone who passed below
pay toll. Well, capital now is exactly what crags were then. Men fight fairly (we will, at
least, grant so much, though it is more than we ought) for their money; but, once having got
it, the fortified millionaire can make everybody who passes below pay toll to his million,
and build another tower of his money castle. And I can tell you, the poor vagrants by the roadside
suffer now quite as much from the bag-baron, as ever they did from the crag-baron. Bags and
crags have just the same result on rags. I have not time, however, to-night to show you in
how many ways the power of capital is unjust; but this one great principle I have to assert--you
will find it quite indisputably true--that whenever money is the principal object of life with
either man or nation, it is both got ill, and spent ill; and does harm both in the getting
and spending; but when it is not the principal object, it and all other things will be well
got, and well spent. And here is the test, with every man, of whether money is the principal
object with him, or not. If in mid-life he could pause and say, "Now I have enough to live
upon, I'll live upon it; and having well earned it, I will also well spend it, and go out of
the world poor, as I came into it," then money is not principal with him; but if, having enough
to live upon in the manner befitting his character and rank, he still wants to make more, and
to die rich, then money is the principal object with him, and it becomes a curse to himself,
and generally to those who spend it after him. For you know it must be spent some day; the
only question is whether the man who makes it shall spend it, or some one else. And generally
it is better for the maker to spend it, for he will know best its value and use. This is the
true law of life. And if a man does not choose thus to spend his money, he must either hoard
it or lend it, and the worst thing he can generally do is to lend it; for borrowers are nearly
always ill-spenders, and it is with lent money that all evil is mainly done, and all unjust
war protracted.

For observe what the real fact is, respecting loans to foreign military governments, and how
strange it is. If your little boy came to you to ask for money to spend in squibs and crackers,
you would think twice before you gave it him; and you would have some idea that it was wasted,
when you saw it fly off in fireworks, even though he did no mischief with it. But the Russian
children, and Austrian children, come to you, borrowing money, not to spend in innocent squibs,
but in cartridges and bayonets to attack you in India with, and to keep down all noble life
in Italy with, and to murder Polish women and children with; and that you will give at once,
because they pay you interest for it. Now, in order to pay you that interest, they must tax
every working peasant in their dominions; and on that work you live. You therefore at once
rob the Austrian peasant, assassinate or banish the Polish peasant, and you live on the produce
of the theft, and the bribe for the assassination! That is the broad fact--that is the practical
meaning of your foreign loans, and of most large interest of money; and then you quarrel with
Bishop Colenso, forsooth, as if he denied the Bible, and you believed it! though, wretches
as you are, every deliberate act of your lives is a new defiance of its primary orders; and
as if, for most of the rich men of England at this moment, it were not indeed to be desired,
as the best thing at least for them, that the Bible should not be true, since against them
these words are written in it: 'The rust of your gold and silver shall be a witness against
you, and shall eat your flesh, as it were fire.'

III. I pass now to our third condition of separation, between the men who work with the hand,
and those who work with the head.

And here we have at last an inevitable distinction. There must be work done by the arms, or
none of us could live. There must be work done by the brains, or the life we get would not
be worth having. And the same men cannot do both. There is rough work to be done, and rough
men must do it; there is gentle work to be done, and gentlemen must do it; and it is physically
impossible that one class should do, or divide, the work of the other. And it is of no use
to try to conceal this sorrowful fact by fine words, and to talk to the workman about the honourableness
of manual labour and the dignity of humanity. That is a grand old proverb of Sancho Panza's,
'Fine words butter no parsnips;' and I can tell you that, all over England just now, you workmen
are buying a great deal too much butter at that dairy. Rough work, honourable or not, takes
the life out of us; and the man who has been heaving clay out of a ditch all day, or driving
an express train against the north wind all night, or holding a collier's helm in a gale on
a lee-shore, or whirling white hot iron at a furnace mouth, that man is not the same at the
end of his day, or night, as one who has been sitting in a quiet room, with everything comfortable
about him, reading books, or classing butterflies, or painting pictures. If it is any comfort
to you to be told that the rough work is the more honourable of the two, I should be sorry
to take that much of consolation from you; and in some sense I need not. The rough work is
at all events real, honest, and, generally, though not always, useful; while the fine work
is, a great deal of it, foolish and false as well as fine, and therefore dishonourable; but
when both kinds are equally well and worthily done, the head's is the noble work, and the hand's
the ignoble; and of all hand work whatsoever, necessary for the maintenance of life, those
old words, 'In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat bread,' indicate that the inherent nature
of it is one of calamity; and that the ground, cursed for our sake, casts also some shadow
of degradation into our contest with its thorn and its thistle; so that all nations have held
their days honourable, or 'holy,' and constituted them 'holydays' or 'holidays,' by making
them days of rest; and the promise, which, among all our distant hopes, seems to cast the chief
brightness over death, is that blessing of the dead who die in the Lord, that 'they rest from
their labours, and their works do follow them.'

And thus the perpetual question and contest must arise, who is to do this rough work? and how
is the worker of it to be comforted, redeemed, and rewarded? and what kind of play should he
have, and what rest, in this world, sometimes, as well as in the next? Well, my good working
friends, these questions will take a little time to answer yet. They must be answered: all
good men are occupied with them, and all honest thinkers. There's grand head work doing about
them; but much must be discovered, and much attempted in vain, before anything decisive can
be told you. Only note these few particulars, which are already sure.

As to the distribution of the hard work. None of us, or very few of us, do either hard or soft
work because we think we ought; but because we have chanced to fall into the way of it, and
cannot help ourselves. Now, nobody does anything well that they cannot help doing: work is
only done well when it is done with a will; and no man has a thoroughly sound will unless he
knows he is doing what he should, and is in his place. And, depend upon it, all work must be
done at last, not in a disorderly, scrambling, doggish way, but in an ordered, soldierly, human
way--a lawful way. Men are enlisted for the labour that kills--the labour of war: they are
counted, trained, fed, dressed, and praised for that. Let them be enlisted also for the labour
that feeds: let them be counted, trained, fed, dressed, praised for that. Teach the plough
exercise as carefully as you do the sword exercise, and let the officers of troops of life
be held as much gentlemen as the officers of troops of death; and all is done: but neither
this, nor any other right thing, can be accomplished--you can't even see your way to it--unless,
first of all, both servant and master are resolved that, come what will of it, they will do
each other justice. People are perpetually squabbling about what will be best to do, or easiest
to do, or adviseablest to do, or profitablest to do; but they never, so far as I hear them
talk, ever ask what it is just to do. And it is the law of heaven that you shall not be able
to judge what is wise or easy, unless you are first resolved to judge what is just, and to
do it. That is the one thing constantly reiterated by our Master--the order of all others that
is given oftenest--'Do justice and judgment.' That's your Bible order; that's the 'Service
of God,' not praying nor psalm-singing. You are told, indeed, to sing psalms when you are merry,
and to pray when you need anything; and, by the perversion of the Evil Spirit, we get to think
that praying and psalm-singing are 'service.' If a child finds itself in want of anything,
it runs in and asks its father for it--does it call that, doing its father a service? If it
begs for a toy or a piece of cake--does it call that serving its father? That, with God, is
prayer, and He likes to hear it: He likes you to ask Him for cake when you want it; but He
doesn't call that 'serving Him.' Begging is not serving: God likes mere beggars as little as
you do--He likes honest servants, not beggars. So when a child loves its father very much,
and is very happy, it may sing little songs about him; but it doesn't call that serving its
father; neither is singing songs about God, serving God. It is enjoying ourselves, if it's
anything; most probably it is nothing; but if it's anything, it is serving ourselves, not God.
And yet we are impudent enough to call our beggings and chauntings 'Divine Service:' we say
'Divine service will be "performed"' (that's our word--the form of it gone through) 'at eleven
o'clock.' Alas!--unless we perform Divine service in every willing act of our life, we never
perform it at all. The one Divine work--the one ordered sacrifice--is to do justice; and it
is the last we are ever inclined to do. Anything rather than that! As much charity as you choose,
but no justice. 'Nay,' you will say, 'charity is greater than justice.' Yes, it is greater;
it is the summit of justice--it is the temple of which justice is the foundation. But you can't
have the top without the bottom; you cannot build upon charity. You must build upon justice,
for this main reason, that you have not, at first, charity to build with. It is the last reward
of good work. Do justice to your brother (you can do that, whether you love him or not), and
you will come to love him. But do injustice to him, because you don't love him; and you will
come to hate him. It is all very fine to think you can build upon charity to begin with; but
you will find all you have got to begin with, begins at home, and is essentially love of yourself.
You well-to-do people, for instance, who are here to-night, will go to 'Divine service' next
Sunday, all nice and tidy, and your little children will have their tight little Sunday boots
on, and lovely little Sunday feathers in their hats; and you'll think, complacently and piously,
how lovely they look! So they do: and you love them heartily and you like sticking feathers
in their hats. That's all right: that is charity; but it is charity beginning at home. Then
you will come to the poor little crossing-sweeper, got up also,--it, in its Sunday dress,--the
dirtiest rags it has,--that it may beg the better: we shall give it a penny, and think how
good we are. That's charity going abroad. But what does Justice say, walking and watching near
us? Christian Justice has been strangely mute, and seemingly blind; and, if not blind, decrepit,
this many a day: she keeps her accounts still, however--quite steadily--doing them at nights,
carefully, with her bandage off, and through acutest spectacles (the only modern scientific
invention she cares about). You must put your ear down ever so close to her lips to hear her
speak; and then you will start at what she first whispers, for it will certainly be, 'Why shouldn't
that little crossing-sweeper have a feather on its head, as well as your own child?' Then you
may ask Justice, in an amazed manner, 'How she can possibly be so foolish as to think children
could sweep crossings with feathers on their heads?' Then you stoop again, and Justice says--still
in her dull, stupid way--'Then, why don't you, every other Sunday, leave your child to sweep
the crossing, and take the little sweeper to church in a hat and feather?' Mercy on us (you
think), what will she say next? And you answer, of course, that 'you don't, because every body
ought to remain content in the position in which Providence has placed them.' Ah, my friends,
that's the gist of the whole question. Did Providence put them in that position, or did you?
You knock a man into a ditch, and then you tell him to remain content in the 'position in which
Providence has placed him.' That's modern Christianity. You say--'We did not knock him into
the ditch.' How do you know what you have done, or are doing? That's just what we have all
got to know, and what we shall never know, until the question with us every morning, is, not
how to do the gainful thing, but how to do the just thing; nor until we are at least so far
on the way to being Christian, as to have understood that maxim of the poor half-way Mahometan,
'One hour in the execution of justice is worth seventy years of prayer.'

Supposing, then, we have it determined with appropriate justice, who is to do the hand work,
the next questions must be how the hand-workers are to be paid, and how they are to be refreshed,
and what play they are to have. Now, the possible quantity of play depends on the possible
quantity of pay; and the quantity of pay is not a matter for consideration to hand-workers
only, but to all workers. Generally, good, useful work, whether of the hand or head, is either
ill-paid, or not paid at all. I don't say it should be so, but it always is so. People, as
a rule, only pay for being amused or being cheated, not for being served. Five thousand a year
to your talker, and a shilling a day to your fighter, digger, and thinker, is the rule. None
of the best head work in art, literature, or science, is ever paid for. How much do you think
Homer got for his Iliad? or Dante for his Paradise? only bitter bread and salt, and going up
and down other people's stairs. In science, the man who discovered the telescope, and first
saw heaven, was paid with a dungeon; the man who invented the microscope, and first saw earth,
died of starvation, driven from his home: it is indeed very clear that God means all thoroughly
good work and talk to be done for nothing. Baruch, the scribe, did not get a penny a line for
writing Jeremiah's second roll for him, I fancy; and St. Stephen did not get bishop's pay for
that long sermon of his to the Pharisees; nothing but stones. For indeed that is the world-father's
proper payment. So surely as any of the world's children work for the world's good, honestly,
with head and heart; and come to it, saying, 'Give us a little bread, just to keep the life
in us,' the world-father answers them, 'No, my children, not bread; a stone, if you like, or
as many as you need, to keep you quiet.' But the hand-workers are not so ill off as all this
comes to. The worst that can happen to you is to break stones; not be broken by them. And for
you there will come a time for better payment; some day, assuredly, more pence will be paid
to Peter the Fisherman, and fewer to Peter the Pope; we shall pay people not quite so much
for talking in Parliament and doing nothing, as for holding their tongues out of it and doing
something; we shall pay our ploughman a little more and our lawyer a little less, and so on:
but, at least, we may even now take care that whatever work is done shall be fully paid for;
and the man who does it paid for it, not somebody else; and that it shall be done in an orderly,
soldierly, well-guided, wholesome way, under good captains and lieutenants of labour; and that
it shall have its appointed times of rest, and enough of them; and that in those times the
play shall be wholesome play, not in theatrical gardens, with tin flowers and gas sunshine,
and girls dancing because of their misery; but in true gardens, with real flowers, and real
sunshine, and children dancing because of their gladness; so that truly the streets shall be
full (the 'streets,' mind you, not the gutters) of children, playing in the midst thereof.
We may take care that working-men shall have at least as good books to read as anybody else,
when they've time to read them; and as comfortable fire-sides to sit at as anybody else, when
they've time to sit at them. This, I think, can be managed for you, my working friends, in
the good time.

IV. I must go on, however, to our last head, concerning ourselves all, as workers. What is
wise work, and what is foolish work? What the difference between sense and nonsense, in daily
occupation?

Well, wise work is, briefly, work with God. Foolish work is work against God. And work done
with God, which He will help, may be briefly described as 'Putting in Order'--that is, enforcing
God's law of order, spiritual and material, over men and things. The first thing you have to
do, essentially; the real 'good work' is, with respect to men, to enforce justice, and with
respect to things, to enforce tidiness, and fruitfulness. And against these two great human
deeds, justice and order, there are perpetually two great demons contending,--the devil of
iniquity, or inequity, and the devil of disorder, or of death; for death is only consummation
of disorder. You have to fight these two fiends daily. So far as you don't fight against the
fiend of iniquity, you work for him. You 'work iniquity,' and the judgment upon you, for all
your 'Lord, Lord's,' will be 'Depart from me, ye that work iniquity.' And so far as you do
not resist the fiend of disorder, you work disorder, and you yourself do the work of Death,
which is sin, and has for its wages, Death himself.

Observe then, all wise work is mainly threefold in character. It is honest, useful, and cheerful.

I. It is HONEST. I hardly know anything more strange than that you recognise honesty in play,
and you do not in work. In your lightest games, you have always some one to see what you call
'fair-play.' In boxing, you must hit fair; in racing, start fair. Your English watchword is
fair-play, your English hatred, foul-play. Did it ever strike you that you wanted another watchword
also, fair-work, and another hatred also, foul-work? Your prize-fighter has some honour in
him yet; and so have the men in the ring round him: they will judge him to lose the match,
by foul hitting. But your prize-merchant gains his match by foul selling, and no one cries
out against that. You drive a gambler out of the gambling-room who loads dice, but you leave
a tradesman in flourishing business, who loads scales! For observe, all dishonest dealing is
loading scales. What does it matter whether I get short weight, adulterate substance, or dishonest
fabric? The fault in the fabric is incomparably the worst of the two. Give me short measure
of food, and I only lose by you; but give me adulterate food, and I die by you. Here, then,
is your chief duty, you workmen and tradesmen--to be true to yourselves, and to us who would
help you. We can do nothing for you, nor you for yourselves, without honesty. Get that, you
get all; without that, your suffrages, your reforms, your free-trade measures, your institutions
of science, are all in vain. It is useless to put your heads together, if you can't put your
hearts together. Shoulder to shoulder, right hand to right hand, among yourselves, and no wrong
hand to anybody else, and you'll win the world yet.

II. Then, secondly, wise work is USEFUL. No man minds, or ought to mind, its being hard, if
only it comes to something; but when it is hard, and comes to nothing; when all our bees' business
turns to spiders'; and for honeycomb we have only resultant cobweb, blown away by the next
breeze--that is the cruel thing for the worker. Yet do we ever ask ourselves, personally, or
even nationally, whether our work is coming to anything or not? We don't care to keep what
has been nobly done; still less do we care to do nobly what others would keep; and, least of
all, to make the work itself useful instead of deadly to the doer, so as to use his life indeed,
but not to waste it. Of all wastes, the greatest waste that you can commit is the waste of
labour. If you went down in the morning into your dairy, and you found that your youngest child
had got down before you; and that he and the cat were at play together, and that he had poured
out all the cream on the floor for the cat to lap up, you would scold the child, and be sorry
the milk was wasted. But if, instead of wooden bowls with milk in them, there are golden bowls
with human life in them, and instead of the cat to play with--the devil to play with; and you
yourself the player; and instead of leaving that golden bowl to be broken by God at the fountain,
you break it in the dust yourself, and pour the human blood out on the ground for the fiend
to lick up--that is no waste! What! you perhaps think, 'to waste the labour of men is not to
kill them.' Is it not? I should like to know how you could kill them more utterly--kill them
with second deaths, seventh deaths, hundredfold deaths? It is the slightest way of killing
to stop a man's breath. Nay, the hunger, and the cold, and the little whistling bullets--our
love-messengers between nation and nation--have brought pleasant messages from us to many a
man before now; orders of sweet release, and leave at last to go where he will be most welcome
and most happy. At the worst you do but shorten his life, you do not corrupt his life. But
if you put him to base labour, if you bind his thoughts, if you blind his eyes, if you blunt
his hopes, if you steal his joys, if you stunt his body, and blast his soul, and at last leave
him not so much as to reap the poor fruit of his degradation, but gather that for yourself,
and dismiss him to the grave, when you have done with him, having, so far as in you lay, made
the walls of that grave everlasting (though, indeed, I fancy the goodly bricks of some of our
family vaults will hold closer in the resurrection day than the sod over the labourer's head),
this you think is no waste, and no sin!

III. Then, lastly, wise work is CHEERFUL, as a child's work is. And now I want you to take
one thought home with you, and let it stay with you.

Everybody in this room has been taught to pray daily, 'Thy kingdom come.' Now, if we hear a
man swear in the streets, we think it very wrong, and say he 'takes God's name in vain.' But
there's a twenty times worse way of taking His name in vain, than that. It is to ask God for
what we don't want. He doesn't like that sort of prayer. If you don't want a thing, don't ask
for it: such asking is the worst mockery of your King you can mock Him with; the soldiers striking
Him on the head with the reed was nothing to that. If you do not wish for His kingdom, don't
pray for it. But if you do, you must do more than pray for it; you must work for it. And, to
work for it, you must know what it is: we have all prayed for it many a day without thinking.
Observe, it is a kingdom that is to come to us; we are not to go to it. Also, it is not to
be a kingdom of the dead, but of the living. Also, it is not to come all at once, but quietly;
nobody knows how. 'The kingdom of God cometh not with observation.' Also, it is not to come
outside of us, but in the hearts of us: 'the kingdom of God is within you.' And, being within
us, it is not a thing to be seen, but to be felt; and though it brings all substance of good
with it, it does not consist in that: 'the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness,
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost:' joy, that is to say, in the holy, healthful, and helpful
Spirit. Now, if we want to work for this kingdom, and to bring it, and enter into it, there's
just one condition to be first accepted. You must enter it as children, or not at all; 'Whosoever
will not receive it as a little child shall not enter therein.' And again, 'Suffer little children
to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.'

Of such, observe. Not of children themselves, but of such as children. I believe most mothers
who read that text think that all heaven is to be full of babies. But that's not so. There
will be children there, but the hoary head is the crown. 'Length of days, and long life and
peace,' that is the blessing, not to die in babyhood. Children die but for their parents sins;
God means them to live, but He can't let them always; then they have their earlier place in
heaven: and the little child of David, vainly prayed for;--the little child of Jeroboam, killed
by its mother's step on its own threshold,--they will be there. But weary old David, and weary
old Barzillai, having learned children's lessons at last, will be there too: and the one question
for us all, young or old, is, have we learned our child's lesson? it is the character of children
we want, and must gain at our peril; let us see, briefly, in what it consists.

The first character of right childhood is that it is Modest. A well-bred child does not think
it can teach its parents, or that it knows everything. It may think its father and mother know
everything,--perhaps that all grown-up people know everything; very certainly it is sure that
it does not. And it is always asking questions, and wanting to know more. Well, that is the
first character of a good and wise man at his work. To know that he knows very little;--to
perceive that there are many above him wiser than he; and to be always asking questions, wanting
to learn, not to teach. No one ever teaches well who wants to teach, or governs well who wants
to govern; it is an old saying (Plato's, but I know not if his, first), and as wise as old.

Then, the second character of right childhood is to be Faithful. Perceiving that its father
knows best what is good for it, and having found always, when it has tried its own way against
his, that he was right and it was wrong, a noble child trusts him at last wholly, gives him
its hand, and will walk blindfold with him, if he bids it. And that is the true character of
all good men also, as obedient workers, or soldiers under captains. They must trust their captains;--they
are bound for their lives to choose none but those whom they can trust. Then, they are not
always to be thinking that what seems strange to them, or wrong in what they are desired to
do, is strange or wrong. They know their captain: where he leads they must follow, what he
bids, they must do; and without this trust and faith, without this captainship and soldiership,
no great deed, no great salvation, is possible to man. Among all the nations it is only when
this faith is attained by them that they become great: the Jew, the Greek, and the Mahometan,
agree at least in testifying to this. It was a deed of this absolute trust which made Abraham
the father of the faithful; it was the declaration of the power of God as captain over all
men, and the acceptance of a leader appointed by Him as commander of the faithful, which laid
the foundation of whatever national power yet exists in the East; and the deed of the Greeks,
which has become the type of unselfish and noble soldiership to all lands, and to all times,
was commemorated, on the tomb of those who gave their lives to do it, in the most pathetic,
so far as I know, or can feel, of all human utterances: 'Oh, stranger, go and tell our people
that we are lying here, having obeyed their words.'

Then the third character of right childhood is to be Loving and Generous. Give a little love
to a child, and you get a great deal back. It loves everything near it, when it is a right
kind of child--would hurt nothing, would give the best it has away, always, if you need it--does
not lay plans for getting everything in the house for itself, and delights in helping people;
you cannot please it so much as by giving it a chance of being useful, in ever so little a way.

And because of all these characters, lastly, it is Cheerful. Putting its trust in its father,
it is careful for nothing--being full of love to every creature, it is happy always, whether
in its play or in its duty. Well, that's the great worker's character also. Taking no thought
for the morrow; taking thought only for the duty of the day; trusting somebody else to take
care of to-morrow; knowing indeed what labour is, but not what sorrow is; and always ready
for play--beautiful play,--for lovely human play is like the play of the Sun. There's a worker
for you. He, steady to his time, is set as a strong man to run his course, but also, he rejoiceth
as a strong man to run his course. See how he plays in the morning, with the mists below, and
the clouds above, with a ray here and a flash there, and a shower of jewels everywhere; that's
the Sun's play; and great human play is like his--all various--all full of light and life,
and tender, as the dew of the morning.

So then, you have the child's character in these four things--Humility, Faith, Charity, and
Cheerfulness. That's what you have got to be converted to. 'Except ye be converted and become
as little children'--You hear much of conversion now-a-days; but people always seem to think
they have got to be made wretched by conversion,--to be converted to long faces. No, friends,
you have got to be converted to short ones; you have to repent into childhood, to repent into
delight, and delightsomeness. You can't go into a conventicle but you'll hear plenty of talk
of backsliding. Backsliding, indeed! I can tell you, on the ways most of us go, the faster
we slide back the better. Slide back into the cradle, if going on is into the grave--back,
I tell you; back--out of your long faces, and into your long clothes. It is among children
only, and as children only, that you will find medicine for your healing and true wisdom for
your teaching. There is poison in the counsels of the men of this world; the words they speak
are all bitterness, 'the poison of asps is under their lips,' but, 'the sucking child shall
play by the hole of the asp.' There is death in the looks of men. 'Their eyes are privily set
against the poor;' they are as the uncharmable serpent, the cockatrice, which slew by seeing.
As far as the east is from the west, so far our sins are--not set from us, but multiplied around
us: the Sun himself, think you he now 'rejoices' to run his course, when he plunges westward
to the horizon, so widely red, not with clouds, but blood? And it will be red more widely yet.
Whatever drought of the early and latter rain may be, there will be none of that red rain.
You fortify yourselves, you arm yourselves against it in vain; the enemy and avenger will be
upon you also, unless you learn that it is not out of the mouths of the knitted gun, or the
smoothed rifle, but 'out of the mouths of babes and sucklings' that the strength is ordained
which shall 'still the enemy and avenger.'

LECTURE II.

TRAFFIC.

(Delivered in the Town Hall, Bradford.)

My good Yorkshire friends, you asked me down here among your hills that I might talk to you
about this Exchange you are going to build: but earnestly and seriously asking you to pardon
me, I am going to do nothing of the kind. I cannot talk, or at least can say very little, about
this same Exchange. I must talk of quite other things, though not willingly;--I could not deserve
your pardon, if when you invited me to speak on one subject, I wilfully spoke on another. But
I cannot speak, to purpose, of anything about which I do not care; and most simply and sorrowfully
I have to tell you, in the outset, that I do not care about this Exchange of yours.

If, however, when you sent me your invitation, I had answered, 'I won't come, I don't care
about the Exchange of Bradford,' you would have been justly offended with me, not knowing the
reasons of so blunt a carelessness. So I have come down, hoping that you will patiently let
me tell you why, on this, and many other such occasions, I now remain silent, when formerly
I should have caught at the opportunity of speaking to a gracious audience.

In a word, then, I do not care about this Exchange,--because you don't; and because you know
perfectly well I cannot make you. Look at the essential circumstances of the case, which you,
as business men, know perfectly well, though perhaps you think I forget them. You are going
to spend 30,000l., which to you, collectively, is nothing; the buying a new coat is, as to
the cost of it, a much more important matter of consideration to me than building a new Exchange
is to you. But you think you may as well have the right thing for your money. You know there
are a great many odd styles of architecture about; you don't want to do anything ridiculous;
you hear of me, among others, as a respectable architectural man-milliner: and you send for
me, that I may tell you the leading fashion; and what is, in our shops, for the moment, the
newest and sweetest thing in pinnacles.

Now, pardon me for telling you frankly, you cannot have good architecture merely by asking
people's advice on occasion. All good architecture is the expression of national life and character;
and it is produced by a prevalent and eager national taste, or desire for beauty. And I want
you to think a little of the deep significance of this word 'taste;' for no statement of mine
has been more earnestly or oftener controverted than that good taste is essentially a moral
quality. 'No,' say many of my antagonists, 'taste is one thing, morality is another. Tell us
what is pretty; we shall be glad to know that; but preach no sermons to us.'

Permit me, therefore, to fortify this old dogma of mine somewhat. Taste is not only a part
and an index of morality--it is the ONLY morality. The first, and last, and closest trial question
to any living creature is, 'What do you like?' Tell me what you like, and I'll tell you what
you are. Go out into the street, and ask the first man or woman you meet, what their 'taste'
is, and if they answer candidly, you know them, body and soul. 'You, my friend in the rags,
with the unsteady gait, what do you like?' 'A pipe and a quartern of gin.' I know you. 'You,
good woman, with the quick step and tidy bonnet, what do you like?' 'A swept hearth and a clean
tea-table, and my husband opposite me, and a baby at my breast.' Good, I know you also. 'You,
little girl with the golden hair and the soft eyes, what do you like?' 'My canary, and a run
among the wood hyacinths.' 'You, little boy with the dirty hands and the low forehead, what
do you like?' 'A shy at the sparrows, and a game at pitch-farthing.' Good; we know them all
now. What more need we ask?

'Nay,' perhaps you answer: 'we need rather to ask what these people and children do, than what
they like. If they do right, it is no matter that they like what is wrong; and if they do wrong,
it is no matter that they like what is right. Doing is the great thing; and it does not matter
that the man likes drinking, so that he does not drink; nor that the little girl likes to be
kind to her canary, if she will not learn her lessons; nor that the little boy likes throwing
stones at the sparrows, if he goes to the Sunday school.' Indeed, for a short time, and in
a provisional sense, this is true. For if, resolutely, people do what is right, in time they
come to like doing it. But they only are in a right moral state when they have come to like
doing it; and as long as they don't like it, they are still in a vicious state. The man is
not in health of body who is always thirsting for the bottle in the cupboard, though he bravely
bears his thirst; but the man who heartily enjoys water in the morning and wine in the evening,
each in its proper quantity and time. And the entire object of true education is to make people
not merely do the right things, but enjoy the right things--not merely industrious, but to
love industry--not merely learned, but to love knowledge--not merely pure, but to love purity--not
merely just, but to hunger and thirst after justice.

But you may answer or think, 'Is the liking for outside ornaments,--for pictures, or statues,
or furniture, or architecture,--a moral quality?' Yes, most surely, if a rightly set liking.
Taste for any pictures or statues is not a moral quality, but taste for good ones is. Only
here again we have to define the word 'good.' I don't mean by 'good,' clever--or learned--or
difficult in the doing. Take a picture by Teniers, of sots quarrelling over their dice: it
is an entirely clever picture; so clever that nothing in its kind has ever been done equal
to it; but it is also an entirely base and evil picture. It is an expression of delight in
the prolonged contemplation of a vile thing, and delight in that is an 'unmannered,' or 'immoral'
quality. It is 'bad taste' in the profoundest sense--it is the taste of the devils. On the
other hand, a picture of Titian's, or a Greek statue, or a Greek coin, or a Turner landscape,
expresses delight in the perpetual contemplation of a good and perfect thing. That is an entirely
moral quality--it is the taste of the angels. And all delight in art, and all love of it, resolve
themselves into simple love of that which deserves love. That deserving is the quality which
we call 'loveliness'--(we ought to have an opposite word, hateliness, to be said of the things
which deserve to be hated); and it is not an indifferent nor optional thing whether we love
this or that; but it is just the vital function of all our being. What we like determines what
we are, and is the sign of what we are; and to teach taste is inevitably to form character.
As I was thinking over this, in walking up Fleet Street the other day, my eye caught the title
of a book standing open in a bookseller's window. It was--'On the necessity of the diffusion
of taste among all classes.' 'Ah,' I thought to myself, 'my classifying friend, when you have
diffused your taste, where will your classes be? The man who likes what you like, belongs to
the same class with you, I think. Inevitably so. You may put him to other work if you choose;
but, by the condition you have brought him into, he will dislike the other work as much as
you would yourself. You get hold of a scavenger, or a costermonger, who enjoyed the Newgate
Calendar for literature, and "Pop goes the Weasel" for music. You think you can make him like
Dante and Beethoven? I wish you joy of your lessons; but if you do, you have made a gentleman
of him:--he won't like to go back to his costermongering.'

And so completely and unexceptionally is this so, that, if I had time to-night, I could show
you that a nation cannot be affected by any vice, or weakness, without expressing it, legibly,
and for ever, either in bad art, or by want of art; and that there is no national virtue, small
or great, which is not manifestly expressed in all the art which circumstances enable the people
possessing that virtue to produce. Take, for instance, your great English virtue of enduring
and patient courage. You have at present in England only one art of any consequence--that is,
iron-working. You know thoroughly well how to cast and hammer iron. Now, do you think in those
masses of lava which you build volcanic cones to melt, and which you forge at the mouths of
the Infernos you have created; do you think, on those iron plates, your courage and endurance
are not written for ever--not merely with an iron pen, but on iron parchment? And take also
your great English vice--European vice--vice of all the world--vice of all other worlds that
roll or shine in heaven, bearing with them yet the atmosphere of hell--the vice of jealousy,
which brings competition into your commerce, treachery into your councils, and dishonour into
your wars--that vice which has rendered for you, and for your next neighbouring nation, the
daily occupations of existence no longer possible, but with the mail upon your breasts and
the sword loose in its sheath; so that, at last, you have realised for all the multitudes of
the two great peoples who lead the so-called civilisation of the earth,--you have realised
for them all, I say, in person and in policy, what was once true only of the rough Border riders
of your Cheviot hills--

                  'They carved at the meal
                   With gloves of steel,
    And they drank the red wine through the helmet barr'd;--

do you think that this national shame and dastardliness of heart are not written as legibly
on every rivet of your iron armour as the strength of the right hands that forged it? Friends,
I know not whether this thing be the more ludicrous or the more melancholy. It is quite unspeakably
both. Suppose, instead of being now sent for by you, I had been sent for by some private gentleman,
living in a suburban house, with his garden separated only by a fruit-wall from his next door
neighbour's; and he had called me to consult with him on the furnishing of his drawing room.
I begin looking about me, and find the walls rather bare; I think such and such a paper might
be desirable--perhaps a little fresco here and there on the ceiling--a damask curtain or so
at the windows. 'Ah,' says my employer, 'damask curtains, indeed! That's all very fine, but
you know I can't afford that kind of thing just now!' 'Yet the world credits you with a splendid
income!' 'Ah, yes,' says my friend, 'but do you know, at present, I am obliged to spend it
nearly all in steel-traps?' 'Steel-traps! for whom?' 'Why, for that fellow on the other side
the wall, you know: we're very good friends, capital friends; but we are obliged to keep our
traps set on both sides of the wall; we could not possibly keep on friendly terms without them,
and our spring guns. The worst of it is, we are both clever fellows enough; and there's never
a day passes that we don't find out a new trap, or a new gun-barrel, or something; we spend
about fifteen millions a year each in our traps, take it all together; and I don't see how
we're to do with less.' A highly comic state of life for two private gentlemen! but for two
nations, it seems to me, not wholly comic? Bedlam would be comic, perhaps, if there were only
one madman in it; and your Christmas pantomime is comic, when there is only one clown in it;
but when the whole world turns clown, and paints itself red with its own heart's blood instead
of vermilion, it is something else than comic, I think.

Mind, I know a great deal of this is play, and willingly allow for that. You don't know what
to do with yourselves for a sensation: fox-hunting and cricketing will not carry you through
the whole of this unendurably long mortal life: you liked pop-guns when you were schoolboys,
and rifles and Armstrongs are only the same things better made: but then the worst of it is,
that what was play to you when boys, was not play to the sparrows; and what is play to you
now, is not play to the small birds of State neither; and for the black eagles, you are somewhat
shy of taking shots at them, if I mistake not.

I must get back to the matter in hand, however. Believe me, without farther instance, I could
show you, in all time, that every nation's vice, or virtue, was written in its art: the soldiership
of early Greece; the sensuality of late Italy; the visionary religion of Tuscany; the splendid
human energy and beauty of Venice. I have no time to do this to-night (I have done it elsewhere
before now); but I proceed to apply the principle to ourselves in a more searching manner.

I notice that among all the new buildings that cover your once wild hills, churches and schools
are mixed in due, that is to say, in large proportion, with your mills and mansions and I notice
also that the churches and schools are almost always Gothic, and the mansions and mills are
never Gothic. Will you allow me to ask precisely the meaning of this? For, remember, it is
peculiarly a modern phenomenon. When Gothic was invented, houses were Gothic as well as churches;
and when the Italian style superseded the Gothic, churches were Italian as well as houses.
If there is a Gothic spire to the cathedral of Antwerp, there is a Gothic belfry to the Hôtel
de Ville at Brussels; if Inigo Jones builds an Italian Whitehall, Sir Christopher Wren builds
an Italian St. Paul's. But now you live under one school of architecture, and worship under
another. What do you mean by doing this? Am I to understand that you are thinking of changing
your architecture back to Gothic; and that you treat your churches experimentally, because
it does not matter what mistakes you make in a church? Or am I to understand that you consider
Gothic a pre-eminently sacred and beautiful mode of building, which you think, like the fine
frankincense, should be mixed for the tabernacle only, and reserved for your religious services?
For if this be the feeling, though it may seem at first as if it were graceful and reverent,
you will find that, at the root of the matter, it signifies neither more nor less than that
you have separated your religion from your life.

For consider what a wide significance this fact has; and remember that it is not you only,
but all the people of England, who are behaving thus just now.

You have all got into the habit of calling the church 'the house of God.' I have seen, over
the doors of many churches, the legend actually carved, 'This is the house of God, and this
is the gate of heaven.' Now, note where that legend comes from, and of what place it was first
spoken. A boy leaves his father's house to go on a long journey on foot, to visit his uncle;
he has to cross a wild hill-desert; just as if one of your own boys had to cross the wolds
of Westmoreland, to visit an uncle at Carlisle. The second or third day your boy finds himself
somewhere between Hawes and Brough, in the midst of the moors, at sunset. It is stony ground,
and boggy; he cannot go one foot farther that night. Down he lies, to sleep, on Wharnside,
where best he may, gathering a few of the stones together to put under his head;--so wild the
place is, he cannot get anything but stones. And there, lying under the broad night, he has
a dream; and he sees a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reaches to heaven, and
the angels of God are ascending and descending upon it. And when he wakes out of his sleep,
he says, 'How dreadful is this place; surely, this is none other than the house of God, and
this is the gate of heaven.' This PLACE, observe; not this church; not this city; not this
stone, even, which he puts up for a memorial--the piece of flint on which his head has lain.
But this place; this windy slope of Wharnside; this moorland hollow, torrent-bitten, snow-blighted;
this any place where God lets down the ladder. And how are you to know where that will be?
or how are you to determine where it may be, but by being ready for it always? Do you know
where the lightning is to fall next? You do know that, partly; you can guide the lightning;
but you cannot guide the going forth of the Spirit, which is that lightning when it shines
from the east to the west.

But the perpetual and insolent warping of that strong verse to serve a merely ecclesiastical
purpose, is only one of the thousand instances in which we sink back into gross Judaism. We
call our churches 'temples.' Now, you know, or ought to know, they are not temples. They have
never had, never can have, anything whatever to do with temples. They are 'synagogues'--'gathering
places'--where you gather yourselves together as an assembly; and by not calling them so, you
again miss the force of another mighty text--'Thou, when thou prayest, shalt not be as the
hypocrites are; for they love to pray standing in the churches' [we should translate it], 'that
they may be seen of men. Not so; I am trying to prove to you the honour of your houses and
your hills; I am trying to show you--not that the Church is not sacred--but that the whole
Earth is. I would have you feel, what careless, what constant, what infectious sin there is
in all modes of thought, whereby, in calling your churches only 'holy,' you call your hearths
and homes profane; and have separated yourselves from the heathen by casting all your household
gods to the ground, instead of recognising, in the place of their many and feeble Lares, the
presence of your One and Mighty Lord and Lar.

'But what has all this to do with our Exchange?' you ask me, impatiently. My dear friends,
it has just everything to do with it; on these inner and great questions depend all the outer
and little ones; and if you have asked me down here to speak to you, because you had before
been interested in anything I have written, you must know that all I have yet said about architecture
was to show this. The book I called 'The Seven Lamps' was to show that certain right states
of temper and moral feeling were the magic powers by which all good architecture, without exception,
had been produced. 'The Stones of Venice,' had, from beginning to end, no other aim than to
show that the Gothic architecture of Venice had arisen out of, and indicated in all its features,
a state of pure national faith, and of domestic virtue; and that its Renaissance architecture
had arisen out of, and in all its features indicated, a state of concealed national infidelity,
and of domestic corruption. And now, you ask me what style is best to build in; and how can
I answer, knowing the meaning of the two styles, but by another question--do you mean to build
as Christians or as Infidels? And still more--do you mean to build as honest Christians or
as honest Infidels? as thoroughly and confessedly either one or the other? You don't like to
be asked such rude questions. I cannot help it; they are of much more importance than this
Exchange business; and if they can be at once answered, the Exchange business settles itself
in a moment. But, before I press them farther, I must ask leave to explain one point clearly.
In all my past work, my endeavour has been to show that good architecture is essentially religious--the
production of a faithful and virtuous, not of an infidel and corrupted people. But in the course
of doing this, I have had also to show that good architecture is not ecclesiastical. People
are so apt to look upon religion as the business of the clergy, not their own, that the moment
they hear of anything depending on 'religion,' they think it must also have depended on the
priesthood; and I have had to take what place was to be occupied between these two errors,
and fight both, often with seeming contradiction. Good architecture is the work of good and
believing men; therefore, you say, at least some people say, 'Good architecture must essentially
have been the work of the clergy, not of the laity.' No--a thousand times no; good architecture
has always been the work of the commonalty, not of the clergy. What, you say, those glorious
cathedrals--the pride of Europe--did their builders not form Gothic architecture? No; they
corrupted Gothic architecture. Gothic was formed in the baron's castle, and the burgher's street.
It was formed by the thoughts, and hands, and powers of free citizens and soldier kings. By
the monk it was used as an instrument for the aid of his superstition; when that superstition
became a beautiful madness, and the best hearts of Europe vainly dreamed and pined in the cloister,
and vainly raged and perished in the crusade--through that fury of perverted faith and wasted
war, the Gothic rose also to its loveliest, most fantastic, and, finally, most foolish dreams;
and, in those dreams, was lost.

I hope, now, that there is no risk of your misunderstanding me when I come to the gist of what
I want to say to-night--when I repeat, that every great national architecture has been the
result and exponent of a great national religion. You can't have bits of it here, bits there--you
must have it everywhere, or nowhere. It is not the monopoly of a clerical company--it is not
the exponent of a theological dogma--it is not the hieroglyphic writing of an initiated priesthood;
it is the manly language of a people inspired by resolute and common purpose, and rendering
resolute and common fidelity to the legible laws of an undoubted God.

Now, there have as yet been three distinct schools of European architecture. I say, European,
because Asiatic and African architectures belong so entirely to other races and climates, that
there is no question of them here; only, in passing, I will simply assure you that whatever
is good or great in Egypt, and Syria, and India, is just good or great for the same reasons
as the buildings on our side of the Bosphorus. We Europeans, then, have had three great religions:
the Greek, which was the worship of the God of Wisdom and Power; the Mediæval, which was the
Worship of the God of Judgment and Consolation; the Renaissance, which was the worship of the
God of Pride and Beauty; these three we have had--they are past,--and now, at last, we English
have got a fourth religion, and a God of our own, about which I want to ask you. But I must
explain these three old ones first.

I repeat, first, the Greeks essentially worshipped the God of Wisdom; so that whatever contended
against their religion,--to the Jews a stumbling block,--was, to the Greeks--Foolishness.

The first Greek idea of Deity was that expressed in the word, of which we keep the remnant
in our words 'Di-urnal' and 'Di-vine'--the god of Day, Jupiter the revealer. Athena is his
daughter, but especially daughter of the Intellect, springing armed from the head. We are only
with the help of recent investigation beginning to penetrate the depth of meaning couched under
the Athenaic symbols: but I may note rapidly, that her ægis, the mantle with the serpent fringes,
in which she often, in the best statues, is represented as folding up her left hand for better
guard, and the Gorgon on her shield, are both representative mainly of the chilling horror
and sadness (turning men to stone, as it were,) of the outmost and superficial spheres of knowledge--that
knowledge which separates, in bitterness, hardness, and sorrow, the heart of the full-grown
man from the heart of the child. For out of imperfect knowledge spring terror, dissension,
danger, and disdain; but from perfect knowledge, given by the full-revealed Athena, strength
and peace, in sign of which she is crowned with the olive spray, and bears the resistless spear.

This, then, was the Greek conception of purest Deity, and every habit of life, and every form
of his art developed themselves from the seeking this bright, serene, resistless wisdom; and
setting himself, as a man, to do things evermore rightly and strongly;[3] not with any ardent
affection or ultimate hope; but with a resolute and continent energy of will, as knowing that
for failure there was no consolation, and for sin there was no remission. And the Greek architecture
rose unerring, bright, clearly defined, and self-contained.

Next followed in Europe the great Christian faith, which was essentially the religion of Comfort.
Its great doctrine is the remission of sins; for which cause it happens, too often, in certain
phases of Christianity, that sin and sickness themselves are partly glorified, as if, the more
you had to be healed of, the more divine was the healing. The practical result of this doctrine,
in art, is a continual contemplation of sin and disease, and of imaginary states of purification
from them; thus we have an architecture conceived in a mingled sentiment of melancholy and
aspiration, partly severe, partly luxuriant, which will bend itself to every one of our needs,
and every one of our fancies, and be strong or weak with us, as we are strong or weak ourselves.
It is, of all architecture, the basest, when base people build it--of all, the noblest, when
built by the noble.

And now note that both these religions--Greek and Mediæval--perished by falsehood in their
own main purpose. The Greek religion of Wisdom perished in a false philosophy--'Oppositions
of science, falsely so called.' The Mediæval religion of Consolation perished in false comfort;
in remission of sins given lyingly. It was the selling of absolution that ended the Mediæval
faith; and I can tell you more, it is the selling of absolution which, to the end of time,
will mark false Christianity. Pure Christianity gives her remission of sins only by ending
them; but false Christianity gets her remission of sins by compounding for them. And there
are many ways of compounding for them. We English have beautiful little quiet ways of buying
absolution, whether in low Church or high, far more cunning than any of Tetzel's trading.

Then, thirdly, there followed the religion of Pleasure, in which all Europe gave itself to
luxury, ending in death. First, bals masqués in every saloon, and then guillotines in every
square. And all these three worships issue in vast temple building. Your Greek worshipped Wisdom,
and built you the Parthenon--the Virgin's temple. The Mediæval worshipped Consolation, and
built you Virgin temples also--but to our Lady of Salvation. Then the Revivalist worshipped
beauty, of a sort, and built you Versailles, and the Vatican. Now, lastly, will you tell me
what we worship, and what we build?

You know we are speaking always of the real, active, continual, national worship; that by which
men act while they live; not that which they talk of when they die. Now, we have, indeed, a
nominal religion, to which we pay tithes of property, and sevenths of time; but we have also
a practical and earnest religion, to which we devote nine-tenths of our property and six-sevenths
of our time. And we dispute a great deal about the nominal religion; but we are all unanimous
about this practical one, of which I think you will admit that the ruling goddess may be best
generally described as the 'Goddess of Getting-on,' or 'Britannia of the Market.' The Athenians
had an 'Athena Agoraia,' or Minerva of the Market: but she was a subordinate type of their
goddess, while our Britannia Agoraia is the principal type of ours. And all your great architectural
works, are, of course, built to her. It is long since you built a great cathedral; and how
you would laugh at me, if I proposed building a cathedral on the top of one of these hills
of yours, taking it for an Acropolis! But your railroad mounds, prolonged masses of Acropolis;
your railroad stations, vaster than the Parthenon, and innumerable; your chimneys, how much
more mighty and costly than cathedral spires! your harbour-piers; your warehouses; your exchanges!--all
these are built to your great Goddess of 'Getting-on;' and she has formed, and will continue
to form, your architecture, as long as you worship her; and it is quite vain to ask me to tell
you how to build to her; you know far better than I.

There might indeed, on some theories, be a conceivably good architecture for Exchanges--that
is to say if there were any heroism in the fact or deed of exchange, which might be typically
carved on the outside of your building. For, you know, all beautiful architecture must be adorned
with sculpture or painting; and for sculpture or painting, you must have a subject. And hitherto
it has been a received opinion among the nations of the world that the only right subjects
for either, were heroisms of some sort. Even on his pots and his flagons, the Greek put a Hercules
slaying lions, or an Apollo slaying serpents, or Bacchus slaying melancholy giants, and earth-born
despondencies. On his temples, the Greek put contests of great warriors in founding states,
or of gods with evil spirits. On his houses and temples alike, the Christian put carvings of
angels conquering devils; or of hero-martyrs exchanging this world for another; subject inappropriate,
I think, to our manner of exchange here. And the Master of Christians not only left his followers
without any orders as to the sculpture of affairs of exchange on the outside of buildings,
but gave some strong evidence of his dislike of affairs of exchange within them. And yet there
might surely be a heroism in such affairs; and all commerce become a kind of selling of doves,
not impious. The wonder has always been great to me, that heroism has never been supposed to
be in anywise consistent with the practice of supplying people with food, or clothes; but rather
with that of quartering oneself upon them for food, and stripping them of their clothes. Spoiling
of armour is an heroic deed in all ages; but the selling of clothes, old, or new, has never
taken any colour of magnanimity. Yet one does not see why feeding the hungry and clothing the
naked should ever become base businesses, even when engaged in on a large scale. If one could
contrive to attach the notion of conquest to them anyhow? so that, supposing there were anywhere
an obstinate race, who refused to be comforted, one might take some pride in giving them compulsory
comfort; and as it were, 'occupying a country' with one's gifts, instead of one's armies? If
one could only consider it as much a victory to get a barren field sown, as to get an eared
field stripped; and contend who should build villages, instead of who should 'carry' them.
Are not all forms of heroism, conceivable in doing these serviceable deeds? You doubt who is
strongest? It might be ascertained by push of spade, as well as push of sword. Who is wisest?
There are witty things to be thought of in planning other business than campaigns. Who is bravest?
There are always the elements to fight with, stronger than men; and nearly as merciless. The
only absolutely and unapproachably heroic element in the soldier's work seems to be--that he
is paid little for it--and regularly: while you traffickers, and exchangers, and others occupied
in presumably benevolent business, like to be paid much for it--and by chance. I never can
make out how it is that a knight-errant does not expect to be paid for his trouble, but a pedlar-errant
always does;--that people are willing to take hard knocks for nothing, but never to sell ribands
cheap;--that they are ready to go on fervent crusades to recover the tomb of a buried God,
never on any travels to fulfil the orders of a living God;--that they will go anywhere barefoot
to preach their faith, but must be well bribed to practise it, and are perfectly ready to give
the Gospel gratis, but never the loaves and fishes. If you chose to take the matter up on any
such soldierly principle, to do your commerce, and your feeding of nations, for fixed salaries;
and to be as particular about giving people the best food, and the best cloth, as soldiers
are about giving them the best gunpowder, I could carve something for you on your exchange
worth looking at. But I can only at present suggest decorating its frieze with pendant purses;
and making its pillars broad at the base for the sticking of bills. And in the innermost chambers
of it there might be a statue of Britannia of the Market, who may have, perhaps advisably,
a partridge for her crest, typical at once of her courage in fighting for noble ideas; and
of her interest in game; and round its neck the inscription in golden letters, 'Perdix fovit
quæ non peperit.'[4] Then, for her spear, she might have a weaver's beam; and on her shield,
instead of her Cross, the Milanese boar, semi-fleeced, with the town of Gennesaret proper,
in the field and the legend 'In the best market,' and her corslet, of leather, folded over
her heart in the shape of a purse, with thirty slits in it for a piece of money to go in at,
on each day of the month. And I doubt not but that people would come to see your exchange,
and its goddess, with applause.

Nevertheless, I want to point out to you certain strange characters in this goddess of yours.
She differs from the great Greek and Mediæval deities essentially in two things--first, as
to the continuance of her presumed power; secondly, as to the extent of it.

1st, as to the Continuance.

The Greek Goddess of Wisdom gave continual increase of wisdom, as the Christian Spirit of Comfort
(or Comforter) continual increase of comfort. There was no question, with these, of any limit
or cessation of function. But with your Agora Goddess, that is just the most important question.
Getting on--but where to? Gathering together--but how much? Do you mean to gather always--never
to spend? If so, I wish you joy of your goddess, for I am just as well off as you, without
the trouble of worshipping her at all. But if you do not spend, somebody else will--somebody
else must. And it is because of this (among many other such errors) that I have fearlessly
declared your so-called science of Political Economy to be no science; because, namely, it
has omitted the study of exactly the most important branch of the business--the study of spending.
For spend you must, and as much as you make, ultimately. You gather corn:--will you bury England
under a heap of grain; or will you, when you have gathered, finally eat? You gather gold:--will
you make your house-roofs of it, or pave your streets with it? That is still one way of spending
it. But if you keep it, that you may get more, I'll give you more; I'll give you all the gold
you want--all you can imagine--if you can tell me what you'll do with it. You shall have thousands
of gold pieces;--thousands of thousands--millions--mountains, of gold: where will you keep
them? Will you put an Olympus of silver upon a golden Pelion--make Ossa like a wart? Do you
think the rain and dew would then come down to you, in the streams from such mountains, more
blessedly than they will down the mountains which God has made for you, of moss and whinstone?
But it is not gold that you want to gather! What is it? greenbacks? No; not those neither.
What is it then--is it ciphers after a capital I? Cannot you practise writing ciphers, and
write as many as you want? Write ciphers for an hour every morning, in a big book, and say
every evening, I am worth all those noughts more than I was yesterday. Won't that do? Well,
what in the name of Plutus is it you want? Not gold, not greenbacks, not ciphers after a capital
I? You will have to answer, after all, 'No; we want, somehow or other, money's worth.' Well,
what is that? Let your Goddess of Getting-on discover it, and let her learn to stay therein.

II. But there is yet another question to be asked respecting this Goddess of Getting-on. The
first was of the continuance of her power; the second is of its extent.

Pallas and the Madonna were supposed to be all the world's Pallas, and all the world's Madonna.
They could teach all men, and they could comfort all men. But, look strictly into the nature
of the power of your Goddess of Getting-on; and you will find she is the Goddess--not of everybody's
getting on--but only of somebody's getting on. This is a vital, or rather deathful, distinction.
Examine it in your own ideal of the state of national life which this Goddess is to evoke and
maintain. I asked you what it was, when I was last here;[5]--you have never told me. Now, shall
I try to tell you?

Your ideal of human life then is, I think, that it should be passed in a pleasant undulating
world, with iron and coal everywhere underneath it. On each pleasant bank of this world is
to be a beautiful mansion, with two wings; and stables, and coach-houses; a moderately sized
park; a large garden and hot houses; and pleasant carriage drives through the shrubberies.
In this mansion are to live the favoured votaries of the Goddess; the English gentleman, with
his gracious wife, and his beautiful family; always able to have the boudoir and the jewels
for the wife, and the beautiful ball dresses for the daughters, and hunters for the sons, and
a shooting in the Highlands for himself. At the bottom of the bank, is to be the mill; not
less than a quarter of a mile long, with a steam engine at each end, and two in the middle,
and a chimney three hundred feet high. In this mill are to be in constant employment from eight
hundred to a thousand workers, who never drink, never strike, always go to church on Sunday,
and always express themselves in respectful language.

Is not that, broadly, and in the main features, the kind of thing you propose to yourselves?
It is very pretty indeed seen from above; not at all so pretty, seen from below. For, observe,
while to one family this deity is indeed the Goddess of Getting on, to a thousand families
she is the Goddess of not Getting on. 'Nay,' you say, 'they have all their chance.' Yes, so
has every one in a lottery, but there must always be the same number of blanks. 'Ah! but in
a lottery it is not skill and intelligence which take the lead, but blind chance.' What then!
do you think the old practice, that 'they should take who have the power, and they should keep
who can,' is less iniquitous, when the power has become power of brains instead of fist? and
that, though we may not take advantage of a child's or a woman's weakness, we may of a man's
foolishness? 'Nay, but finally, work must be done, and some one must be at the top, some one
at the bottom.' Granted, my friends. Work must always be, and captains of work must always
be; and if you in the least remember the tone of any of my writings, you must know that they
are thought unfit for this age, because they are always insisting on need of government, and
speaking with scorn of liberty. But I beg you to observe that there is a wide difference between
being captains or governors of work, and taking the profits of it. It does not follow, because
you are general of an army, that you are to take all the treasure, or land, it wins (if it
fight for treasure or land); neither, because you are king of a nation, that you are to consume
all the profits of the nation's work. Real kings, on the contrary, are known invariably by
their doing quite the reverse of this,--by their taking the least possible quantity of the
nation's work for themselves. There is no test of real kinghood so infallible as that. Does
the crowned creature live simply, bravely, unostentatiously? probably he is a King. Does he
cover his body with jewels, and his table with delicates? in all probability he is not a King.
It is possible he may be, as Solomon was; but that is when the nation shares his splendour
with him. Solomon made gold, not only to be in his own palace as stones, but to be in Jerusalem
as stones. But even so, for the most part, these splendid kinghoods expire in ruin, and only
the true kinghoods live, which are of royal labourers governing loyal labourers; who, both
leading rough lives, establish the true dynasties. Conclusively you will find that because
you are king of a nation, it does not follow that you are to gather for yourself all the wealth
of that nation; neither, because you are king of a small part of the nation, and lord over
the means of its maintenance--over field, or mill, or mine, are you to take all the produce
of that piece of the foundation of national existence for yourself.

You will tell me I need not preach against these things, for I cannot mend them. No, good friends,
I cannot; but you can, and you will; or something else can and will. Do you think these phenomena
are to stay always in their present power or aspect? All history shows, on the contrary, that
to be the exact thing they never can do. Change must come; but it is ours to determine whether
change of growth, or change of death. Shall the Parthenon be in ruins on its rock, and Bolton
priory in its meadow, but these mills of yours be the consummation of the buildings of the
earth, and their wheels be as the wheels of eternity? Think you that 'men may come, and men
may go,' but--mills--go on forever? Not so; out of these, better or worse shall come; and it
is for you to choose which.

I know that none of this wrong is done with deliberate purpose. I know, on the contrary, that
you wish your workmen well; that you do much for them, and that you desire to do more for them,
if you saw your way to it safely. I know that many of you have done, and are every day doing,
whatever you feel to be in your power; and that even all this wrong and misery are brought
about by a warped sense of duty, each of you striving to do his best, without noticing that
this best is essentially and centrally the best for himself, not for others. And all this has
come of the spreading of that thrice accursed, thrice impious doctrine of the modern economist,
that 'To do the best for yourself, is finally to do the best for others.' Friends, our great
Master said not so; and most absolutely we shall find this world is not made so. Indeed, to
do the best for others, is finally to do the best for ourselves; but it will not do to have
our eyes fixed on that issue. The Pagans had got beyond that. Hear what a Pagan says of this
matter; hear what were, perhaps, the last written words of Plato,--if not the last actually
written (for this we cannot know), yet assuredly in fact and power his parting words--in which,
endeavouring to give full crowning and harmonious close to all his thoughts, and to speak the
sum of them by the imagined sentence of the Great Spirit, his strength and his heart fail him,
and the words cease, broken off for ever. It is the close of the dialogue called 'Critias,'
in which he describes, partly from real tradition, partly in ideal dream, the early state of
Athens; and the genesis, and order, and religion, of the fabled isle of Atlantis; in which
genesis he conceives the same first perfection and final degeneracy of man, which in our own
Scriptural tradition is expressed by saying that the Sons of God intermarried with the daughters
of men, for he supposes the earliest race to have been indeed the children of God; and to have
corrupted themselves, until 'their spot was not the spot of his children.' And this, he says,
was the end; that indeed 'through many generations, so long as the God's nature in them yet
was full, they were submissive to the sacred laws, and carried themselves lovingly to all that
had kindred with them in divineness; for their uttermost spirit was faithful and true, and
in every wise great; so that, in all meekness of wisdom, they dealt with each other, and took
all the chances of life; and despising all things except virtue, they cared little what happened
day by day, and bore lightly the burden of gold and of possessions; for they saw that, if only
their common love and virtue increased, all these things would be increased together with them;
but to set their esteem and ardent pursuit upon material possession would be to lose that first,
and their virtue and affection together with it. And by such reasoning, and what of the divine
nature remained in them, they gained all this greatness of which we have already told, but
when the God's part of them faded and became extinct, being mixed again and again, and effaced
by the prevalent mortality; and the human nature at last exceeded, they then became unable
to endure the courses of fortune; and fell into shapelessness of life, and baseness in the
sight of him who could see, having lost everything that was fairest of their honour; while
to the blind hearts which could not discern the true life, tending to happiness, it seemed
that they were then chiefly noble and happy, being filled with all iniquity of inordinate possession
and power. Whereupon, the God of God's, whose Kinghood is in laws, beholding a once just nation
thus cast into misery, and desiring to lay such punishment upon them as might make them repent
into restraining, gathered together all the gods into his dwelling-place, which from heaven's
centre overlooks whatever has part in creation; and having assembled them, he said'----

The rest is silence. So ended are the last words of the chief wisdom of the heathen, spoken
of this idol of riches; this idol of yours; this golden image high by measureless cubits, set
up where your green fields of England are furnace-burnt into the likeness of the plain of Dura:
this idol, forbidden to us, first of all idols, by our own Master and faith; forbidden to us
also by every human lip that has ever, in any age or people, been accounted of as able to speak
according to the purposes of God. Continue to make that forbidden deity your principal one,
and soon no more art, no more science, no more pleasure will be possible. Catastrophe will
come; or worse than catastrophe, slow mouldering and withering into Hades. But if you can fix
some conception of a true human state of life to be striven for--life for all men as for yourselves--if
you can determine some honest and simple order of existence; following those trodden ways of
wisdom, which are pleasantness, and seeking her quiet and withdrawn paths, which are peace;--then,
and so sanctifying wealth into 'commonwealth,' all your art, your literature, your daily labours,
your domestic affection, and citizen's duty, will join and increase into one magnificent harmony.
You will know then how to build, well enough; you will build with stone well, but with flesh
better; temples not made with hands, but riveted of hearts; and that kind of marble, crimson-veined,
is indeed eternal.

FOOTNOTES:

[3] It is an error to suppose that the Greek worship, or seeking, was chiefly of Beauty. It
was essentially of Rightness and Strength, founded on Forethought: the principal character
of Greek art is not Beauty, but Design: and the Dorian Apollo-worship and Athenian Virgin-worship
are both expressions of adoration of divine Wisdom and Purity. Next to these great deities
rank, in power over the national mind, Dionysus and Ceres, the givers of human strength and
life: then, for heroic example, Hercules. There is no Venus-worship among the Greek in the
great times: and the Muses are essentially teachers of Truth, and of its harmonies.

LECTURE III.

WAR.

(Delivered at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.)

Young soldiers, I do not doubt but that many of you came unwillingly to-night, and many in
merely contemptuous curiosity, to hear what a writer on painting could possibly say, or would
venture to say, respecting your great art of war. You may well think within yourselves, that
a painter might, perhaps without immodesty, lecture younger painters upon painting, but not
young lawyers upon law, nor young physicians upon medicine--least of all, it may seem to you,
young warriors upon war. And, indeed, when I was asked to address you, I declined at first,
and declined long; for I felt that you would not be interested in my special business, and
would certainly think there was small need for me to come to teach you yours. Nay, I knew that
there ought to be no such need, for the great veteran soldiers of England are now men every
way so thoughtful, so noble, and so good, that no other teaching than their knightly example,
and their few words of grave and tried counsel should be either necessary for you, or even,
without assurance of due modesty in the offerer, endured by you.

But being asked, not once nor twice, I have not ventured persistently to refuse; and I will
try, in very few words, to lay before you some reason why you should accept my excuse, and
hear me patiently. You may imagine that your work is wholly foreign to, and separate from mine.
So far from that, all the pure and noble arts of peace are founded on war; no great art ever
yet rose on earth, but among a nation of soldiers. There is no art among a shepherd people,
if it remains at peace. There is no art among an agricultural people, if it remains at peace.
Commerce is barely consistent with fine art; but cannot produce it. Manufacture not only is
unable to produce it, but invariably destroys whatever seeds of it exist. There is no great
art possible to a nation but that which is based on battle.

Now, though I hope you love fighting for its own sake, you must, I imagine, be surprised at
my assertion that there is any such good fruit of fighting. You supposed, probably, that your
office was to defend the works of peace, but certainly not to found them: nay, the common course
of war, you may have thought, was only to destroy them. And truly, I who tell you this of the
use of war, should have been the last of men to tell you so, had I trusted my own experience
only. Hear why: I have given a considerable part of my life to the investigation of Venetian
painting and the result of that enquiry was my fixing upon one man as the greatest of all Venetians,
and therefore, as I believed, of all painters whatsoever. I formed this faith, (whether right
or wrong matters at present nothing,) in the supremacy of the painter Tintoret, under a roof
covered with his pictures; and of those pictures, three of the noblest were then in the form
of shreds of ragged canvas, mixed up with the laths of the roof, rent through by three Austrian
shells. Now it is not every lecturer who could tell you that he had seen three of his favourite
pictures torn to rags by bombshells. And after such a sight, it is not every lecturer who would
tell you that, nevertheless, war was the foundation of all great art.

Yet the conclusion is inevitable, from any careful comparison of the states of great historic
races at different periods. Merely to show you what I mean, I will sketch for you, very briefly,
the broad steps of the advance of the best art of the world. The first dawn of it is in Egypt;
and the power of it is founded on the perpetual contemplation of death, and of future judgment,
by the mind of a nation of which the ruling caste were priests, and the second, soldiers. The
greatest works produced by them are sculptures of their kings going out to battle, or receiving
the homage of conquered armies. And you must remember also, as one of the great keys to the
splendour of the Egyptian nation, that the priests were not occupied in theology only. Their
theology was the basis of practical government and law, so that they were not so much priests
as religious judges, the office of Samuel, among the Jews, being as nearly as possible correspondent
to theirs.

All the rudiments of art then, and much more than the rudiments of all science, are laid first
by this great warrior-nation, which held in contempt all mechanical trades, and in absolute
hatred the peaceful life of shepherds. From Egypt art passes directly into Greece, where all
poetry, and all painting, are nothing else than the description, praise, or dramatic representation
of war, or of the exercises which prepare for it, in their connection with offices of religion.
All Greek institutions had first respect to war; and their conception of it, as one necessary
office of all human and divine life, is expressed simply by the images of their guiding gods.
Apollo is the god of all wisdom of the intellect; he bears the arrow and the bow, before he
bears the lyre. Again, Athena is the goddess of all wisdom in conduct. It is by the helmet
and the shield, oftener than by the shuttle, that she is distinguished from other deities.

There were, however, two great differences in principle between the Greek and the Egyptian
theories of policy. In Greece there was no soldier caste; every citizen was necessarily a soldier.
And, again, while the Greeks rightly despised mechanical arts as much as the Egyptians, they
did not make the fatal mistake of despising agricultural and pastoral life; but perfectly honoured
both. These two conditions of truer thought raise them quite into the highest rank of wise
manhood that has yet been reached; for all our great arts, and nearly all our great thoughts,
have been borrowed or derived from them. Take away from us what they have given; and I hardly
can imagine how low the modern European would stand.

Now, you are to remember, in passing to the next phase of history, that though you must have
war to produce art--you must also have much more than war; namely, an art-instinct or genius
in the people; and that, though all the talent for painting in the world won't make painters
of you, unless you have a gift for fighting as well, you may have the gift for fighting, and
none for painting. Now, in the next great dynasty of soldiers, the art-instinct is wholly wanting.
I have not yet investigated the Roman character enough to tell you the causes of this; but
I believe, paradoxical as it may seem to you, that, however truly the Roman might say of himself
that he was born of Mars, and suckled by the wolf, he was nevertheless, at heart, more of a
farmer than a soldier. The exercises of war were with him practical, not poetical; his poetry
was in domestic life only, and the object of battle, 'pacis imponere morem.' And the arts are
extinguished in his hands, and do not rise again, until, with Gothic chivalry, there comes
back into the mind of Europe a passionate delight in war itself, for the sake of war. And then,
with the romantic knighthood which can imagine no other noble employment,--under the fighting
kings of France, England, and Spain; and under the fighting dukeships and citizenships of Italy,
art is born again, and rises to her height in the great valleys of Lombardy and Tuscany, through
which there flows not a single stream, from all their Alps or Apennines, that did not once
run dark red from battle: and it reaches its culminating glory in the city which gave to history
the most intense type of soldiership yet seen among men;--the city whose armies were led in
their assault by their king, led through it to victory by their king, and so led, though that
king of theirs was blind, and in the extremity of his age.

And from this time forward, as peace is established or extended in Europe, the arts decline.
They reach an unparalleled pitch of costliness, but lose their life, enlist themselves at last
on the side of luxury and various corruption, and, among wholly tranquil nations, wither utterly
away; remaining only in partial practice among races who, like the French and us, have still
the minds, though we cannot all live the lives, of soldiers.

'It may be so,' I can suppose that a philanthropist might exclaim. 'Perish then the arts, if
they can flourish only at such a cost. What worth is there in toys of canvas and stone if compared
to the joy and peace of artless domestic life?' And the answer is--truly, in themselves, none.
But as expressions of the highest state of the human spirit, their worth is infinite. As results
they may be worthless, but, as signs, they are above price. For it is an assured truth that,
whenever the faculties of men are at their fulness, they must express themselves by art; and
to say that a state is without such expression, is to say that it is sunk from its proper level
of manly nature. So that, when I tell you that war is the foundation of all the arts, I mean
also that it is the foundation of all the high virtues and faculties of men.

It was very strange to me to discover this; and very dreadful--but I saw it to be quite an
undeniable fact. The common notion that peace and the virtues of civil life flourished together,
I found, to be wholly untenable. Peace and the vices of civil life only flourish together.
We talk of peace and learning, and of peace and plenty, and of peace and civilisation; but
I found that those were not the words which the Muse of History coupled together: that on her
lips, the words were--peace and sensuality, peace and selfishness, peace and corruption, peace
and death. I found, in brief, that all great nations learned their truth of word, and strength
of thought, in war; that they were nourished in war, and wasted by peace; taught by war, and
deceived by peace; trained by war, and betrayed by peace;--in a word, that they were born in
war, and expired in peace.

Yet now note carefully, in the second place, it is not all war of which this can be said--nor
all dragon's teeth, which, sown, will start up into men. It is not the ravage of a barbarian
wolf-flock, as under Genseric or Suwarrow; nor the habitual restlessness and rapine of mountaineers,
as on the old borders of Scotland; nor the occasional struggle of a strong peaceful nation
for its life, as in the wars of the Swiss with Austria; nor the contest of merely ambitious
nations for extent of power, as in the wars of France under Napoleon, or the just terminated
war in America. None of these forms of war build anything but tombs. But the creative or foundational
war is that in which the natural restlessness and love of contest among men are disciplined,
by consent, into modes of beautiful--though it may be fatal--play: in which the natural ambition
and love of power of men are disciplined into the aggressive conquest of surrounding evil:
and in which the natural instincts of self-defence are sanctified by the nobleness of the institutions,
and purity of the households, which they are appointed to defend. To such war as this all men
are born; in such war as this any man may happily die; and forth from such war as this have
arisen throughout the extent of past ages, all the highest sanctities and virtues of humanity.

I shall therefore divide the war of which I would speak to you into three heads. War for exercise
or play; war for dominion; and, war for defence.

I. And first, of war for exercise or play. I speak of it primarily in this light, because,
through all past history, manly war has been more an exercise than anything else, among the
classes who cause, and proclaim it. It is not a game to the conscript, or the pressed sailor;
but neither of these are the causers of it. To the governor who determines that war shall be,
and to the youths who voluntarily adopt it as their profession, it has always been a grand
pastime; and chiefly pursued because they had nothing else to do. And this is true without
any exception. No king whose mind was fully occupied with the development of the inner resources
of his kingdom, or with any other sufficing subject of thought, ever entered into war but on
compulsion. No youth who was earnestly busy with any peaceful subject of study, or set on any
serviceable course of action, ever voluntarily became a soldier. Occupy him early, and wisely,
in agriculture or business, in science or in literature, and he will never think of war otherwise
than as a calamity. But leave him idle; and, the more brave and active and capable he is by
nature, the more he will thirst for some appointed field for action; and find, in the passion
and peril of battle, the only satisfying fulfilment of his unoccupied being. And from the earliest
incipient civilisation until now, the population of the earth divides itself, when you look
at it widely, into two races; one of workers, and the other of players--one tilling the ground,
manufacturing, building, and otherwise providing for the necessities of life;--the other part
proudly idle, and continually therefore needing recreation, in which they use the productive
and laborious orders partly as their cattle, and partly as their puppets or pieces in the game
of death.

Now, remember, whatever virtue or goodliness there may be in this game of war, rightly played,
there is none when you thus play it with a multitude of small human pawns.

If you, the gentlemen of this or any other kingdom, choose to make your pastime of contest,
do so, and welcome; but set not up these unhappy peasant-pieces upon the green fielded board.
If the wager is to be of death, lay it on your own heads, not theirs. A goodly struggle in
the Olympic dust, though it be the dust of the grave, the gods will look upon, and be with
you in; but they will not be with you, if you sit on the sides of the amphitheatre, whose steps
are the mountains of earth, whose arena its valleys, to urge your peasant millions into gladiatorial
war. You also, you tender and delicate women, for whom, and by whose command, all true battle
has been, and must ever be; you would perhaps shrink now, though you need not, from the thought
of sitting as queens above set lists where the jousting game might be mortal. How much more,
then, ought you to shrink from the thought of sitting above a theatre pit in which even a few
condemned slaves were slaying each other only for your delight! And do you not shrink from
the fact of sitting above a theatre pit, where,--not condemned slaves,--but the best and bravest
of the poor sons of your people, slay each other,--not man to man,--as the coupled gladiators;
but race to race, in duel of generations? You would tell me, perhaps, that you do not sit to
see this; and it is indeed true, that the women of Europe--those who have no heart-interests
of their own at peril in the contest--draw the curtains of their boxes, and muffle the openings;
so that from the pit of the circus of slaughter there may reach them only at intervals a half-heard
cry and a murmur as of the wind's sighing, when myriads of souls expire. They shut out the
death-cries; and are happy, and talk wittily among themselves. That is the utter literal fact
of what our ladies do in their pleasant lives.

Nay, you might answer, speaking for them--'We do not let these wars come to pass for our play,
nor by our carelessness; we cannot help them. How can any final quarrel of nations be settled
otherwise than by war?' I cannot now delay, to tell you how political quarrels might be otherwise
settled. But grant that they cannot. Grant that no law of reason can be understood by nations;
no law of justice submitted to by them: and that, while questions of a few acres, and of petty
cash, can be determined by truth and equity, the questions which are to issue in the perishing
or saving of kingdoms can be determined only by the truth of the sword, and the equity of the
rifle. Grant this, and even then, judge if it will always be necessary for you to put your
quarrel into the hearts of your poor, and sign your treaties with peasants' blood. You would
be ashamed to do this in your own private position and power. Why should you not be ashamed
also to do it in public place and power? If you quarrel with your neighbour, and the quarrel
be indeterminable by law, and mortal, you and he do not send your footmen to Battersea fields
to fight it out; nor do you set fire to his tenants' cottages, nor spoil their goods. You fight
out your quarrel yourselves, and at your own danger, if at all. And you do not think it materially
affects the arbitrement that one of you has a larger household than the other; so that, if
the servants or tenants were brought into the field with their masters, the issue of the contest
could not be doubtful? You either refuse the private duel, or you practise it under laws of
honour, not of physical force; that so it may be, in a manner, justly concluded. Now the just
or unjust conclusion of the private feud is of little moment, while the just or unjust conclusion
of the public feud is of eternal moment: and yet, in this public quarrel, you take your servants'
sons from their arms to fight for it, and your servants' food from their lips to support it;
and the black seals on the parchment of your treaties of peace are the deserted hearth and
the fruitless field. There is a ghastly ludicrousness in this, as there is mostly in these
wide and universal crimes. Hear the statement of the very fact of it in the most literal words
of the greatest of our English thinkers:--

     'What, speaking in quite unofficial language, is the
     net-purport and upshot of war? To my own knowledge, for
     example, there dwell and toil, in the British village of
     Dumdrudge, usually some five hundred souls. From these, by
     certain "natural enemies" of the French, there are
     successively selected, during the French war, say thirty
     able-bodied men. Dumdrudge, at her own expense, has suckled
     and nursed them; she has, not without difficulty and sorrow,
     fed them up to manhood, and even trained them to crafts, so
     that one can weave, another build, another hammer, and the
     weakest can stand under thirty stone avoirdupois.
     Nevertheless, amid much weeping and swearing, they are
     selected; all dressed in red; and shipped away, at the
     public charges, some two thousand miles, or say only to the
     south of Spain; and fed there till wanted.

     'And now to that same spot in the south of Spain are thirty
     similar French artisans, from a French Dumdrudge, in like
     manner wending; till at length, after infinite effort, the
     two parties come into actual juxtaposition; and Thirty
     stands fronting Thirty, each with a gun in his hand.

     'Straightway the word "Fire!" is given, and they blow the
     souls out of one another, and in place of sixty brisk useful
     craftsmen, the world has sixty dead carcases, which it must
     bury, and anon shed tears for. Had these men any quarrel?
     Busy as the devil is, not the smallest! They lived far
     enough apart; were the entirest strangers; nay, in so wide a
     universe, there was even, unconsciously, by commerce, some
     mutual helpfulness between them. How then? Simpleton! their
     governors had fallen out; and instead of shooting one
     another, had the cunning to make these poor blockheads
     shoot.' (Sartor Resartus.)

Positively, then, gentlemen, the game of battle must not, and shall not, ultimately be played
this way. But should it be played any way? Should it, if not by your servants, be practised
by yourselves? I think, yes. Both history and human instinct seem alike to say, yes. All healthy
men like fighting, and like the sense of danger; all brave women like to hear of their fighting,
and of their facing danger. This is a fixed instinct in the fine race of them; and I cannot
help fancying that fair fight is the best play for them, and that a tournament was a better
game than a steeple-chase. The time may perhaps come in France as well as here, for universal
hurdle-races and cricketing: but I do not think universal 'crickets' will bring out the best
qualities of the nobles of either country. I use, in such question, the test which I have adopted,
of the connection of war with other arts; and I reflect how, as a sculptor, I should feel,
if I were asked to design a monument for a dead knight, in Westminster abbey, with a carving
of a bat at one end, and a ball at the other. It may be the remains in me only of savage Gothic
prejudice; but I had rather carve it with a shield at one end, and a sword at the other. And
this, observe, with no reference whatever to any story of duty done, or cause defended. Assume
the knight merely to have ridden out occasionally to fight his neighbour for exercise; assume
him even a soldier of fortune, and to have gained his bread, and filled his purse, at the sword's
point. Still, I feel as if it were, somehow, grander and worthier in him to have made his bread
by sword play than any other play; had rather he had made it by thrusting than by batting;--much
more, than by betting. Much rather that he should ride war horses, than back race horses; and--I
say it sternly and deliberately--much rather would I have him slay his neighbour, than cheat him.

But remember, so far as this may be true, the game of war is only that in which the full personal
power of the human creature is brought out in management of its weapons. And this for three
reasons:--

First, the great justification of this game is that it truly, when well played, determines
who is the best man;--who is the highest bred, the most self-denying, the most fearless, the
coolest of nerve, the swiftest of eye and hand. You cannot test these qualities wholly, unless
there is a clear possibility of the struggle's ending in death. It is only in the fronting
of that condition that the full trial of the man, soul and body, comes out. You may go to your
game of wickets, or of hurdles, or of cards, and any knavery that is in you may stay unchallenged
all the while. But if the play may be ended at any moment by a lance-thrust, a man will probably
make up his accounts a little before he enters it. Whatever is rotten and evil in him will
weaken his hand more in holding a sword hilt, than in balancing a billiard cue; and on the
whole, the habit of living lightly hearted, in daily presence of death, always has had, and
must have, a tendency both to the making and testing of honest men. But for the final testing,
observe, you must make the issue of battle strictly dependent on fineness of frame, and firmness
of hand. You must not make it the question, which of the combatants has the longest gun, or
which has got behind the biggest tree, or which has the wind in his face, or which has gunpowder
made by the best chemist, or iron smelted with the best coal, or the angriest mob at his back.
Decide your battle, whether of nations, or individuals, on those terms;--and you have only
multiplied confusion, and added slaughter to iniquity. But decide your battle by pure trial
which has the strongest arm, and steadiest heart,--and you have gone far to decide a great
many matters besides, and to decide them rightly.

And the other reasons for this mode of decision of cause, are the diminution both of the material
destructiveness, or cost, and of the physical distress of war. For you must not think that
in speaking to you in this (as you may imagine), fantastic praise of battle, I have overlooked
the conditions weighing against me. I pray all of you, who have not read, to read with the
most earnest attention, Mr. Helps's two essays on War and Government, in the first volume of
the last series of 'Friends in Council.' Everything that can be urged against war is there
simply, exhaustively, and most graphically stated. And all, there urged, is true. But the two
great counts of evil alleged against war by that most thoughtful writer, hold only against
modern war. If you have to take away masses of men from all industrial employment,--to feed
them by the labour of others,--to move them and provide them with destructive machines, varied
daily in national rivalship of inventive cost; if you have to ravage the country which you
attack,--to destroy for a score of future years, its roads, its woods, its cities, and its
harbours;--and if, finally, having brought masses of men, counted by hundreds of thousands,
face to face, you tear those masses to pieces with jagged shot, and leave the fragments of
living creatures countlessly beyond all help of surgery, to starve and parch, through days
of torture, down into clots of clay--what book of accounts shall record the cost of your work;--What
book of judgment sentence the guilt of it?

That, I say, is modern war,--scientific war,--chemical and mechanic war, worse even than the
savage's poisoned arrow. And yet you will tell me, perhaps, that any other war than this is
impossible now. It may be so; the progress of science cannot, perhaps, be otherwise registered
than by new facilities of destruction; and the brotherly love of our enlarging Christianity
be only proved by multiplication of murder. Yet hear, for a moment, what war was, in Pagan
and ignorant days;--what war might yet be, if we could extinguish our science in darkness,
and join the heathen's practice to the Christian's theory. I read you this from a book which
probably most of you know well, and all ought to know--Muller's 'Dorians;'--but I have put
the points I wish you to remember in closer connection than in his text.

'The chief characteristic of the warriors of Sparta was great composure and subdued strength;
the violence [Greek: lyssa] of Aristodemus and Isadas being considered as deserving rather
of blame than praise; and these qualities in general distinguished the Greeks from the northern
Barbarians, whose boldness always consisted in noise and tumult. For the same reason the Spartans
sacrificed to the Muses before an action; these goddesses being expected to produce regularity
and order in battle; as they sacrificed on the same occasion in Crete to the god of love, as
the confirmer of mutual esteem and shame. Every man put on a crown, when the band of flute-players
gave the signal for attack; all the shields of the line glittered with their high polish, and
mingled their splendour with the dark red of the purple mantles, which were meant both to adorn
the combatant, and to conceal the blood of the wounded; to fall well and decorously being an
incentive the more to the most heroic valour. The conduct of the Spartans in battle denotes
a high and noble disposition, which rejected all the extremes of brutal rage. The pursuit of
the enemy ceased when the victory was completed; and after the signal for retreat had been
given, all hostilities ceased. The spoiling of arms, at least during the battle, was also interdicted;
and the consecration of the spoils of slain enemies to the gods, as, in general, all rejoicings
for victory, were considered as ill-omened.

Such was the war of the greatest soldiers who prayed to heathen gods. What Christian war is,
preached by Christian ministers, let any one tell you, who saw the sacred crowning, and heard
the sacred flute-playing, and was inspired and sanctified by the divinely-measured and musical
language, of any North American regiment preparing for its charge. And what is the relative
cost of life in pagan and Christian wars, let this one fact tell you:--the Spartans won the
decisive battle of Corinth with the loss of eight men; the victors at indecisive Gettysburg
confess to the loss of 30,000.

II. I pass now to our second order of war, the commonest among men, that undertaken in desire
of dominion. And let me ask you to think for a few moments what the real meaning of this desire
of dominion is--first in the minds of kings--then in that of nations.

Now, mind you this first,--that I speak either about kings, or masses of men, with a fixed
conviction that human nature is a noble and beautiful thing; not a foul nor a base thing. All
the sin of men I esteem as their disease, not their nature; as a folly which may be prevented,
not a necessity which must be accepted. And my wonder, even when things are at their worst,
is always at the height which this human nature can attain. Thinking it high, I find it always
a higher thing than I thought it; while those who think it low, find it, and will find it,
always lower than they thought it: the fact being, that it is infinite, and capable of infinite
height and infinite fall; but the nature of it--and here is the faith which I would have you
hold with me--the nature of it is in the nobleness, not in the catastrophe.

Take the faith in its utmost terms. When the captain of the 'London' shook hands with his mate,
saying 'God speed you! I will go down with my passengers,' that I believe to be 'human nature.'
He does not do it from any religious motive--from any hope of reward, or any fear of punishment;
he does it because he is a man. But when a mother, living among the fair fields of merry England,
gives her two-year-old child to be suffocated under a mattress in her inner room, while the
said mother waits and talks outside; that I believe to be not human nature. You have the two
extremes there, shortly. And you, men, and mothers, who are here face to face with me to-night,
I call upon you to say which of these is human, and which inhuman--which 'natural' and which
'unnatural?' Choose your creed at once, I beseech you:--choose it with unshaken choice--choose
it forever. Will you take, for foundation of act and hope, the faith that this man was such
as God made him, or that this woman was such as God made her? Which of them has failed from
their nature--from their present, possible, actual nature;--not their nature of long ago, but
their nature of now? Which has betrayed it--falsified it? Did the guardian who died in his
trust, die inhumanly, and as a fool; and did the murderess of her child fulfil the law of her
being? Choose, I say; infinitude of choices hang upon this. You have had false prophets among
you--for centuries you have had them--solemnly warned against them though you were; false prophets,
who have told you that all men are nothing but fiends or wolves, half beast, half devil. Believe
that and indeed you may sink to that. But refuse that, and have faith that God 'made you upright,'
though you have sought out many inventions; so, you will strive daily to become more what your
Maker meant and means you to be, and daily gives you also the power to be--and you will cling
more and more to the nobleness and virtue that is in you, saying, 'My righteousness I hold
fast, and will not let it go.'

I have put this to you as a choice, as if you might hold either of these creeds you liked best.
But there is in reality no choice for you; the facts being quite easily ascertainable. You
have no business to think about this matter, or to choose in it. The broad fact is, that a
human creature of the highest race, and most perfect as a human thing, is invariably both kind
and true; and that as you lower the race, you get cruelty and falseness, as you get deformity:
and this so steadily and assuredly, that the two great words which, in their first use, meant
only perfection of race, have come, by consequence of the invariable connection of virtue with
the fine human nature, both to signify benevolence of disposition. The word generous, and the
word gentle, both, in their origin, meant only 'of pure race,' but because charity and tenderness
are inseparable from this purity of blood, the words which once stood only for pride, now stand
as synonyms for virtue.

Now, this being the true power of our inherent humanity, and seeing that all the aim of education
should be to develop this;--and seeing also what magnificent self sacrifice the higher classes
of men are capable of, for any cause that they understand or feel,--it is wholly inconceivable
to me how well-educated princes, who ought to be of all gentlemen the gentlest, and of all
nobles the most generous, and whose title of royalty means only their function of doing every
man 'right'--how these, I say, throughout history, should so rarely pronounce themselves on
the side of the poor and of justice, but continually maintain themselves and their own interests
by oppression of the poor, and by wresting of justice; and how this should be accepted as so
natural, that the word loyalty, which means faithfulness to law, is used as if it were only
the duty of a people to be loyal to their king, and not the duty of a king to be infinitely
more loyal to his people. How comes it to pass that a captain will die with his passengers,
and lean over the gunwale to give the parting boat its course; but that a king will not usually
die with, much less for, his passengers,--thinks it rather incumbent on his passengers, in
any number, to die for him? Think, I beseech you, of the wonder of this. The sea captain, not
captain by divine right, but only by company's appointment;--not a man of royal descent, but
only a plebeian who can steer;--not with the eyes of the world upon him, but with feeble chance,
depending on one poor boat, of his name being ever heard above the wash of the fatal waves;--not
with the cause of a nation resting on his act, but helpless to save so much as a child from
among the lost crowd with whom he resolves to be lost,--yet goes down quietly to his grave,
rather than break his faith to these few emigrants. But your captain by divine right,--your
captain with the hues of a hundred shields of kings upon his breast,--your captain whose every
deed, brave or base, will be illuminated or branded for ever before unescapable eyes of men,--your
captain whose every thought and act are beneficent, or fatal, from sunrising to setting, blessing
as the sunshine, or shadowing as the night,--this captain, as you find him in history, for
the most part thinks only how he may tax his passengers, and sit at most ease in his state cabin!

For observe, if there had been indeed in the hearts of the rulers of great multitudes of men
any such conception of work for the good of those under their command, as there is in the good
and thoughtful masters of any small company of men, not only wars for the sake of mere increase
of power could never take place, but our idea of power itself would be entirely altered. Do
you suppose that to think and act even for a million of men, to hear their complaints, watch
their weaknesses, restrain their vices, make laws for them, lead them, day by day, to purer
life, is not enough for one man's work? If any of us were absolute lord only of a district
of a hundred miles square, and were resolved on doing our utmost for it; making it feed as
large a number of people as possible; making every clod productive, and every rock defensive,
and every human being happy; should we not have enough on our hands think you? But if the ruler
has any other aim than this; if, careless of the result of his interference, he desire only
the authority to interfere; and, regardless of what is ill-done or well-done, cares only that
it shall be done at his bidding,--if he would rather do two hundred miles' space of mischief,
than one hundred miles' space of good, of course he will try to add to his territory; and to
add inimitably. But does he add to his power? Do you call it power in a child, if he is allowed
to play with the wheels and bands of some vast engine, pleased with their murmur and whirl,
till his unwise touch, wandering where it ought not, scatters beam and wheel into ruin? Yet
what machine is so vast, so incognisable, as the working of the mind of a nation what child's
touch so wanton, as the word of a selfish king? And yet, how long have we allowed the historian
to speak of the extent of the calamity a man causes, as a just ground for his pride; and to
extol him as the greatest prince, who is only the centre of the widest error. Follow out this
thought by yourselves; and you will find that all power, properly so called, is wise and benevolent.
There may be capacity in a drifting fire-ship to destroy a fleet; there may be venom enough
in a dead body to infect a nation:--but which of you, the most ambitious, would desire a drifting
kinghood, robed in consuming fire, or a poison-dipped sceptre whose touch was mortal? There
is no true potency, remember, but that of help; nor true ambition, but ambition to save.

And then, observe farther, this true power, the power of saving, depends neither on multitude
of men, nor on extent of territory. We are continually assuming that nations become strong
according to their numbers. They indeed become so, if those numbers can be made of one mind;
but how are you sure you can stay them in one mind, and keep them from having north and south
minds? Grant them unanimous, how know you they will be unanimous in right? If they are unanimous
in wrong, the more they are, essentially the weaker they are. Or, suppose that they can neither
be of one mind, nor of two minds, but can only be of no mind? Suppose they are a more helpless
mob; tottering into precipitant catastrophe, like a waggon load of stones when the wheel comes
off. Dangerous enough for their neighbours, certainly, but not 'powerful.'

Neither does strength depend on extent of territory, any more than upon number of population.
Take up your maps when you go home this evening,--put the cluster of British Isles beside the
mass of South America; and then consider whether any race of men need care how much ground
they stand upon. The strength is in the men, and in their unity and virtue, not in their standing
room: a little group of wise hearts is better than a wilderness full of fools; and only that
nation gains true territory, which gains itself.

And now for the brief practical outcome of all this. Remember, no government is ultimately
strong, but in proportion to its kindness and justice; and that a nation does not strengthen,
by merely multiplying and diffusing itself. We have not strengthened as yet, by multiplying
into America. Nay, even when it has not to encounter the separating conditions of emigration,
a nation need not boast itself of multiplying on its own ground, if it multiplies only as flies
or locusts do, with the god of flies for its god. It multiplies its strength only by increasing
as one great family, in perfect fellowship and brotherhood. And lastly, it does not strengthen
itself by seizing dominion over races whom it cannot benefit. Austria is not strengthened,
but weakened, by her grasp of Lombardy; and whatever apparent increase of majesty and of wealth
may have accrued to us from the possession of India, whether these prove to us ultimately power
or weakness, depends wholly on the degree in which our influence on the native race shall be
benevolent and exalting. But, as it is at their own peril that any race extends their dominion
in mere desire of power, so it is at their own still greater peril, that they refuse to undertake
aggressive war, according to their force, whenever they are assured that their authority would
be helpful and protective. Nor need you listen to any sophistical objection of the impossibility
of knowing when a people's help is needed, or when not. Make your national conscience clean,
and your national eyes will soon be clear. No man who is truly ready to take part in a noble
quarrel will ever stand long in doubt by whom, or in what cause, his aid is needed. I hold
it my duty to make no political statement of any special bearing in this presence; but I tell
you broadly and boldly, that, within these last ten years, we English have, as a knightly nation,
lost our spurs: we have fought where we should not have fought, for gain; and we have been
passive where we should not have been passive, for fear. I tell you that the principle of non-intervention,
as now preached among us, is as selfish and cruel as the worst frenzy of conquest, and differs
from it only by being not only malignant, but dastardly.

I know, however, that my opinions on this subject differ too widely from those ordinarily held,
to be any farther intruded upon you; and therefore I pass lastly to examine the conditions
of the third kind of noble war;--war waged simply for defence of the country in which we were
born, and for the maintenance and execution of her laws, by whomsoever threatened or defied.
It is to this duty that I suppose most men entering the army consider themselves in reality
to be bound, and I want you now to reflect what the laws of mere defence are; and what the
soldier's duty, as now understood, or supposed to be understood. You have solemnly devoted
yourselves to be English soldiers, for the guardianship of England. I want you to feel what
this vow of yours indeed means, or is gradually coming to mean. You take it upon you, first,
while you are sentimental schoolboys; you go into your military convent, or barracks, just
as a girl goes into her convent while she is a sentimental schoolgirl; neither of you then
know what you are about, though both the good soldiers and good nuns make the best of it afterwards.
You don't understand perhaps why I call you 'sentimental' schoolboys, when you go into the
army? Because, on the whole, it is love of adventure, of excitement, of fine dress and of the
pride of fame, all which are sentimental motives, which chiefly make a boy like going into
the Guards better than into a counting-house. You fancy, perhaps, that there is a severe sense
of duty mixed with these peacocky motives? And in the best of you, there is; but do not think
that it is principal. If you cared to do your duty to your country in a prosaic and unsentimental
way, depend upon it, there is now truer duty to be done in raising harvests than in burning
them; more in building houses, than in shelling them--more in winning money by your own work,
wherewith to help men, than in taxing other people's work, for money wherewith to slay men;
more duty finally, in honest and unselfish living than in honest and unselfish dying, though
that seems to your boys' eyes the bravest. So far then, as for your own honour, and the honour
of your families, you choose brave death in a red coat before brave life in a black one, you
are sentimental; and now see what this passionate vow of yours comes to. For a little while
you ride, and you hunt tigers or savages, you shoot, and are shot; you are happy, and proud,
always, and honoured and wept if you die; and you are satisfied with your life, and with the
end of it; believing, on the whole, that good rather than harm of it comes to others, and much
pleasure to you. But as the sense of duty enters into your forming minds, the vow takes another
aspect. You find that you have put yourselves into the hand of your country as a weapon. You
have vowed to strike, when she bids you, and to stay scabbarded when she bids you; all that
you need answer for is, that you fail not in her grasp. And there is goodness in this, and
greatness, if you can trust the hand and heart of the Britomart who has braced you to her side,
and are assured that when she leaves you sheathed in darkness, there is no need for your flash
to the sun. But remember, good and noble as this state may be, it is a state of slavery. There
are different kinds of slaves and different masters. Some slaves are scourged to their work
by whips, others are scourged to it by restlessness or ambition. It does not matter what the
whip is; it is none the less a whip, because you have cut thongs for it out of your own souls:
the fact, so far, of slavery, is in being driven to your work without thought, at another's
bidding. Again, some slaves are bought with money, and others with praise. It matters not what
the purchase-money is. The distinguishing sign of slavery is to have a price, and be bought
for it. Again, it matters not what kind of work you are set on; some slaves are set to forced
diggings, others to forced marches; some dig furrows, others field-works, and others graves.
Some press the juice of reeds, and some the juice of vines, and some the blood of men. The
fact of the captivity is the same whatever work we are set upon, though the fruits of the toil
may be different. But, remember, in thus vowing ourselves to be the slaves of any master, it
ought to be some subject of forethought with us, what work he is likely to put us upon. You
may think that the whole duty of a soldier is to be passive, that it is the country you have
left behind who is to command, and you have only to obey. But are you sure that you have left
all your country behind, or that the part of it you have so left is indeed the best part of
it? Suppose--and, remember, it is quite conceivable--that you yourselves are indeed the best
part of England; that you who have become the slaves, ought to have been the masters; and that
those who are the masters, ought to have been the slaves! If it is a noble and whole-hearted
England, whose bidding you are bound to do, it is well; but if you are yourselves the best
of her heart, and the England you have left be but a half-hearted England, how say you of your
obedience? You were too proud to become shopkeepers: are you satisfied then to become the servants
of shopkeepers? You were too proud to become merchants or farmers yourselves: will you have
merchants or farmers then for your field marshals? You had no gifts of special grace for Exeter
Hall: will you have some gifted person thereat for your commander-in-chief, to judge of your
work, and reward it? You imagine yourselves to be the army of England: how if you should find
yourselves, at last, only the police of her manufacturing towns, and the beadles of her little
Bethels?

It is not so yet, nor will be so, I trust, for ever; but what I want you to see, and to be
assured of, is, that the ideal of soldiership is not mere passive obedience and bravery; that,
so far from this, no country is in a healthy state which has separated, even in a small degree,
her civil from her military power. All states of the world, however great, fall at once when
they use mercenary armies; and although it is a less instant form of error (because involving
no national taint of cowardice), it is yet an error no less ultimately fatal--it is the error
especially of modern times, of which we cannot yet know all the calamitous consequences--to
take away the best blood and strength of the nation, all the soul-substance of it that is brave,
and careless of reward, and scornful of pain, and faithful in trust; and to cast that into
steel, and make a mere sword of it; taking away its voice and will; but to keep the worst part
of the nation--whatever is cowardly, avaricious, sensual, and faithless--and to give to this
the voice, to this the authority, to this the chief privilege, where there is least capacity,
of thought. The fulfilment of your vow for the defence of England will by no means consist
in carrying out such a system. You are not true soldiers, if you only mean to stand at a shop
door, to protect shop-boys who are cheating inside. A soldier's vow to his country is that
he will die for the guardianship of her domestic virtue, of her righteous laws, and of her
anyway challenged or endangered honour. A state without virtue, without laws, and without honour,
he is bound not to defend; nay, bound to redress by his own right hand that which he sees to
be base in her. So sternly is this the law of Nature and life, that a nation once utterly corrupt
can only be redeemed by a military despotism--never by talking, nor by its free effort. And
the health of any state consists simply in this: that in it, those who are wisest shall also
be strongest; its rulers should be also its soldiers; or, rather, by force of intellect more
than of sword, its soldiers its rulers. Whatever the hold which the aristocracy of England
has on the heart of England, in that they are still always in front of her battles, this hold
will not be enough, unless they are also in front of her thoughts. And truly her thoughts need
good captain's leading now, if ever! Do you know what, by this beautiful division of labour
(her brave men fighting, and her cowards thinking), she has come at last to think? Here is
a bit of paper in my hand,[6] a good one too, and an honest one; quite representative of the
best common public thought of England at this moment; and it is holding forth in one of its
leaders upon our 'social welfare,'--upon our 'vivid life'--upon the 'political supremacy of
Great Britain.' And what do you think all these are owing to? To what our English sires have
done for us, and taught us, age after age? No: not to that. To our honesty of heart, or coolness
of head, or steadiness of will? No: not to these. To our thinkers, or our statesmen, or our
poets, or our captains, or our martyrs, or the patient labour of our poor? No: not to these;
or at least not to these in any chief measure. Nay, says the journal, 'more than any agency,
it is the cheapness and abundance of our coal which have made us what we are.' If it be so,
then 'ashes to ashes' be our epitaph! and the sooner the better. I tell you, gentlemen of England,
if ever you would have your country breathe the pure breath of heaven again, and receive again
a soul into her body, instead of rotting into a carcase, blown up in the belly with carbonic
acid (and great that way), you must think, and feel, for your England, as well as fight for
her: you must teach her that all the true greatness she ever had, or ever can have, she won
while her fields were green and her faces ruddy;--that greatness is still possible for Englishmen,
even though the ground be not hollow under their feet, nor the sky black over their heads;--and
that, when the day comes for their country to lay her honours in the dust, her crest will not
rise from it more loftily because it is dust of coal. Gentlemen, I tell you, solemnly, that
the day is coming when the soldiers of England must be her tutors and the captains of her army,
captains also of her mind.

And now, remember, you soldier youths, who are thus in all ways the hope of your country; or
must be, if she have any hope: remember that your fitness for all future trust depends upon
what you are now. No good soldier in his old age was ever careless or indolent in his youth.
Many a giddy and thoughtless boy has become a good bishop, or a good lawyer, or a good merchant;
but no such an one ever became a good general. I challenge you, in all history, to find a record
of a good soldier who was not grave and earnest in his youth. And, in general, I have no patience
with people who talk about 'the thoughtlessness of youth' indulgently, I had infinitely rather
hear of thoughtless old age, and the indulgence due to that. When a man has done his work,
and nothing can any way be materially altered in his fate, let him forget his toil, and jest
with his fate, if he will; but what excuse can you find for wilfulness of thought, at the very
time when every crisis of future fortune hangs on your decisions? A youth thoughtless! when
all the happiness of his home for ever depends on the chances, or the passions, of an hour!
A youth thoughtless! when the career of all his days depends on the opportunity of a moment!
A youth thoughtless! when his every act is a foundation-stone of future conduct, and every
imagination a fountain of life or death! Be thoughtless in any after years, rather than now--though,
indeed, there is only one place where a man may be nobly thoughtless,--his deathbed. No thinking
should ever be left to be done there.

Having, then, resolved that you will not waste recklessly, but earnestly use, these early days
of yours, remember that all the duties of her children to England may be summed in two words--industry,
and honour. I say first, industry, for it is in this that soldier youth are especially tempted
to fail. Yet surely, there is no reason because your life may possibly or probably be shorter
than other men's, that you should therefore waste more recklessly the portion of it that is
granted you; neither do the duties of your profession, which require you to keep your bodies
strong, in any wise involve the keeping of your minds weak. So far from that, the experience,
the hardship, and the activity of a soldier's life render his powers of thought more accurate
than those of other men; and while, for others, all knowledge is often little more than a means
of amusement, there is no form of science which a soldier may not at some time or other find
bearing on business of life and death. A young mathematician may be excused for langour in
studying curves to be described only with a pencil; but not in tracing those which are to be
described with a rocket. Your knowledge of a wholesome herb may involve the feeding of an army;
and acquaintance with an obscure point of geography, the success of a campaign. Never waste
an instant's time, therefore; the sin of idleness is a thousandfold greater in you than in
other youths; for the fates of those who will one day be under your command hang upon your
knowledge; lost moments now will be lost lives then, and every instant which you carelessly
take for play, you buy with blood. But there is one way of wasting time, of all the vilest,
because it wastes, not time only, but the interest and energy of your minds. Of all the ungentlemanly
habits into which you can fall, the vilest is betting, or interesting yourselves in the issues
of betting. It unites nearly every condition of folly and vice; you concentrate your interest
upon a matter of chance, instead of upon a subject of true knowledge; and you back opinions
which you have no grounds for forming, merely because they are your own. All the insolence
of egotism is in this; and so far as the love of excitement is complicated with the hope of
winning money, you turn yourselves into the basest sort of tradesmen--those who live by speculation.
Were there no other ground for industry, this would be a sufficient one; that it protected
you from the temptation to so scandalous a vice. Work faithfully, and you will put yourselves
in possession of a glorious and enlarging happiness: not such as can be won by the speed of
a horse, or marred by the obliquity of a ball.

First, then, by industry you must fulfil your vow to your country; but all industry and earnestness
will be useless unless they are consecrated by your resolution to be in all things men of honour;
not honour in the common sense only, but in the highest. Rest on the force of the two main
words in the great verse, integer vitæ, scelerisque purus. You have vowed your life to England;
give it her wholly--a bright, stainless, perfect life--a knightly life. Because you have to
fight with machines instead of lances, there may be a necessity for more ghastly danger, but
there is none for less worthiness of character, than in olden time. You may be true knights
yet, though perhaps not equites; you may have to call yourselves 'cannonry' instead of 'chivalry,'
but that is no reason why you should not call yourselves true men. So the first thing you have
to see to in becoming soldiers is that you make yourselves wholly true. Courage is a mere matter
of course among any ordinarily well-born youths; but neither truth nor gentleness is matter
of course. You must bind them like shields about your necks; you must write them on the tables
of your hearts. Though it be not exacted of you, yet exact it of yourselves, this vow of stainless
truth. Your hearts are, if you leave them unstirred, as tombs in which a god lies buried. Vow
yourselves crusaders to redeem that sacred sepulchre. And remember, before all things--for
no other memory will be so protective of you--that the highest law of this knightly truth is
that under which it is vowed to women. Whomsoever else you deceive, whomsoever you injure,
whomsoever you leave unaided, you must not deceive, nor injure, nor leave unaided according
to your power, any woman of whatever rank. Believe me, every virtue of the higher phases of
manly character begins in this;--in truth and modesty before the face of all maidens; in truth
and pity, or truth and reverence, to all womanhood.

And now let me turn for a moment to you,--wives and maidens, who are the souls of soldiers;
to you,--mothers, who have devoted your children to the great hierarchy of war. Let me ask
you to consider what part you have to take for the aid of those who love you; for if you fail
in your part they cannot fulfil theirs; such absolute helpmates you are that mo man can stand
without that help, nor labour in his own strength.

I know your hearts, and that the truth of them never fails when an hour of trial comes which
you recognise for such. But you know not when the hour of trial first finds you, nor when it
verily finds you. You imagine that you are only called upon to wait and to suffer; to surrender
and to mourn. You know that you must not weaken the hearts of your husbands and lovers, even
by the one fear of which those hearts are capable,--the fear of parting from you, or of causing
you grief. Through weary years of separation, through fearful expectancies of unknown fate;
through the tenfold bitterness of the sorrow which might so easily have been joy, and the tenfold
yearning for glorious life struck down in its prime--through all these agonies you fail not,
and never will fail. But your trial is not in these. To be heroic in danger is little;--you
are Englishwomen. To be heroic in change and sway of fortune is little;--for do you not love?
To be patient through the great chasm and pause of loss is little;--for do you not still love
in heaven? But to be heroic in happiness; to bear yourselves gravely and righteously in the
dazzling of the sunshine of morning; not to forget the God in whom you trust, when He gives
you most; not to fail those who trust you, when they seem to need you least; this is the difficult
fortitude. It is not in the pining of absence, not in the peril of battle, not in the wasting
of sickness, that your prayer should be most passionate, or your guardianship most tender.
Pray, mothers and maidens, for your young soldiers in the bloom of their pride; pray for them,
while the only dangers round them are in their own wayward wills; watch you, and pray, when
they have to face, not death, but temptation. But it is this fortitude also for which there
is the crowning reward. Believe me, the whole course and character of your lovers' lives is
in your hands; what you would have them be, they shall be, if you not only desire to have them
so, but deserve to have them so; for they are but mirrors in which you will see yourselves
imaged. If you are frivolous, they will be so also; if you have no understanding of the scope
of their duty, they also will forget it; they will listen,--they can listen,--to no other interpretation
of it than that uttered from your lips. Bid them be brave;--they will be brave for you; bid
them be cowards; and how noble soever they be;--they will quail for you. Bid them be wise,
and they will be wise for you; mock at their counsel, they will be fools for you: such and
so absolute is your rule over them. You fancy, perhaps, as you have been told so often, that
a wife's rule should only be over her husband's house, not over his mind. Ah, no! the true
rule is just the reverse of that; a true wife, in her husband's house, is his servant; it is
in his heart that she is queen. Whatever of the best he can conceive, it is her part to be;
whatever of highest he can hope, it is hers to promise; all that is dark in him she must purge
into purity; all that is failing in him she must strengthen into truth: from her, through all
the world's clamour, he must win his praise; in her, through all the world's warfare, he must
find his peace.

And, now, but one word more. You may wonder, perhaps, that I have spoken all this night in
praise of war. Yet, truly, if it might be, I, for one, would fain join in the cadence of hammer-strokes
that should beat swords into ploughshares: and that this cannot be, is not the fault of us
men. It is your fault. Wholly yours. Only by your command, or by your permission, can any contest
take place among us. And the real, final, reason for all the poverty, misery, and rage of battle,
throughout Europe, is simply that you women, however good, however religious, however self-sacrificing
for those whom you love, are too selfish and too thoughtless to take pains for any creature
out of your own immediate circles. You fancy that you are sorry for the pain of others. Now
I just tell you this, that if the usual course of war, instead of unroofing peasants' houses,
and ravaging peasants' fields, merely broke the china upon your own drawing-room tables, no
war in civilised countries would last a week. I tell you more, that at whatever moment you
chose to put a period to war, you could do it with less trouble than you take any day to go
out to dinner. You know, or at least you might know if you would think, that every battle you
hear of has made many widows and orphans. We have, none of us, heart enough truly to mourn
with these. But at least we might put on the outer symbols of mourning with them. Let but every
Christian lady who has conscience toward God, vow that she will mourn, at least outwardly,
for His killed creatures. Your praying is useless, and your churchgoing mere mockery of God,
if you have not plain obedience in you enough for this. Let every lady in the upper classes
of civilised Europe simply vow that, while any cruel war proceeds, she will wear black;--a
mute's black,--with no jewel, no ornament, no excuse for, or evasion into, prettiness.--I tell
you again, no war would last a week.

And lastly. You women of England are all now shrieking with one voice,--you and your clergymen
together,--because you hear of your Bibles being attacked. If you choose to obey your Bibles,
you will never care who attacks them. It is just because you never fulfil a single downright
precept of the Book, that you are so careful for its credit: and just because you don't care
to obey its whole words, that you are so particular about the letters of them. The Bible tells
you to dress plainly,--and you are mad for finery; the Bible tells you to have pity on the
poor,--and you crush them under your carriage-wheels; the Bible tells you to do judgment and
justice,--and you do not know, nor care to know, so much as what the Bible word 'justice means.'
Do but learn so much of God's truth as that comes to; know what He means when He tells you
to be just: and teach your sons, that their bravery is but a fool's boast, and their deeds
but a firebrand's tossing, unless they are indeed Just men, and Perfect in the Fear of God;--and
you will soon have no more war, unless it be indeed such as is willed by Him, of whom, though
Prince of Peace, it is also written, 'In Righteousness He doth judge, and make war.'

FOOTNOTES:

[6] I do not care to refer to the journal quoted, because the article was unworthy of its general
tone, though in order to enable the audience to verify the quoted sentence, I left the number
containing it on the table, when I delivered this lecture. But a saying of Baron Liebig's,
quoted at the head of a leader on the same subject in the 'Daily Telegraph' of January 11,
1866, summarily digests and presents the maximum folly of modern thought in this respect. 'Civilization,'
says the Baron, 'is the economy of power, and English power is coal.' Not altogether so, my
chemical friend. Civilization is the making of civil persons, which is a kind of distillation
of which alembics are incapable, and does not at all imply the turning of a small company of
gentlemen into a large company of ironmongers. And English power (what little of it may be
left), is by no means coal, but, indeed, of that which, 'when the whole world turns to coal,
then chiefly lives.'

MUNERA PULVERIS

SIX ESSAYS

ON THE ELEMENTS OF

POLITICAL ECONOMY

PREFACE.

The following pages contain, I believe, the first accurate analysis of the laws of Political
Economy which has been published in England. Many treatises, within their scope, correct, have
appeared in contradiction of the views popularly received; but no exhaustive examination of
the subject was possible to any person unacquainted with the value of the products of the highest
industries, commonly called the "Fine Arts;" and no one acquainted with the nature of those
industries has, so far as I know, attempted, or even approached, the task.

So that, to the date (1863) when these Essays were published, not only the chief conditions
of the production of wealth had remained unstated, but the nature of wealth itself had never
been defined. "Every one has a notion, sufficiently correct for common purposes, of what is
meant by wealth," wrote Mr. Mill, in the outset of his treatise; and contentedly proceeded,
as if a chemist should proceed to investigate the laws of chemistry without endeavouring to
ascertain the nature of fire or water, because every one had a notion of them, "sufficiently
correct for common purposes."

But even that apparently indisputable statement was untrue. There is not one person in ten
thousand who has a notion sufficiently correct, even for the commonest purposes, of "what is
meant" by wealth; still less of what wealth everlastingly is, whether we mean it or not; which
it is the business of every student of economy to ascertain. We, indeed, know (either by experience
or in imagination) what it is to be able to provide ourselves with luxurious food, and handsome
clothes; and if Mr. Mill had thought that wealth consisted only in these, or in the means of
obtaining these, it would have been easy for him to have so defined it with perfect scientific
accuracy. But he knew better: he knew that some kinds of wealth consisted in the possession,
or power of obtaining, other things than these; but, having, in the studies of his life, no
clue to the principles of essential value, he was compelled to take public opinion as the ground
of his science; and the public, of course, willingly accepted the notion of a science founded
on their opinions.

I had, on the contrary, a singular advantage, not only in the greater extent of the field of
investigation opened to me by my daily pursuits, but in the severity of some lessons I accidentally
received in the course of them.

When, in the winter of 1851, I was collecting materials for my work on Venetian architecture,
three of the pictures of Tintoret on the roof of the School of St. Roch were hanging down in
ragged fragments, mixed with lath and plaster, round the apertures made by the fall of three
Austrian heavy shot. The city of Venice was not, it appeared, rich enough to repair the damage
that winter; and buckets were set on the floor of the upper room of the school to catch the
rain, which not only fell directly through the shot holes, but found its way, owing to the
generally pervious state of the roof, through many of the canvases of Tintoret's in other parts
of the ceiling.

It was a lesson to me, as I have just said, no less direct than severe; for I knew already
at that time (though I have not ventured to assert, until recently at Oxford,) that the pictures
of Tintoret in Venice were accurately the most precious articles of wealth in Europe, being
the best existing productions of human industry. Now at the time that three of them were thus
fluttering in moist rags from the roof they had adorned, the shops of the Rue Rivoli at Paris
were, in obedience to a steadily-increasing public Demand, beginning to show a steadily-increasing
Supply of elaborately-finished and coloured lithographs, representing the modern dances of
delight, among which the cancan has since taken a distinguished place.

The labour employed on the stone of one of these lithographs is very much more than Tintoret
was in the habit of giving to a picture of average size. Considering labour as the origin of
value, therefore, the stone so highly wrought would be of greater value than the picture; and
since also it is capable of producing a large number of immediately saleable or exchangeable
impressions, for which the "demand" is constant, the city of Paris naturally supposed itself,
and on all hitherto believed or stated principles of political economy, was, infinitely richer
in the possession of a large number of these lithographic stones, (not to speak of countless
oil pictures and marble carvings of similar character), than Venice in the possession of those
rags of mildewed canvas, flaunting in the south wind and its salt rain. And, accordingly, Paris
provided (without thought of the expense) lofty arcades of shops, and rich recesses of innumerable
private apartments, for the protection of these better treasures of hers from the weather.

Yet, all the while, Paris was not the richer for these possessions. Intrinsically, the delightful
lithographs were not wealth, but polar contraries of wealth. She was, by the exact quantity
of labour she had given to produce these, sunk below, instead of above, absolute Poverty. They
not only were false Riches--they were true Debt, which had to be paid at last--and the present
aspect of the Rue Rivoli shows in what manner.

And the faded stains of the Venetian ceiling, all the while, were absolute and inestimable
wealth. Useless to their possessors as forgotten treasure in a buried city, they had in them,
nevertheless, the intrinsic and eternal nature of wealth; and Venice, still possessing the
ruins of them, was a rich city; only, the Venetians had not a notion sufficiently correct even
for the very common purpose of inducing them to put slates on a roof, of what was "meant by
wealth."

The vulgar economist would reply that his science had nothing to do with the qualities of pictures,
but with their exchange-value only; and that his business was, exclusively, to consider whether
the remains of Tintoret were worth as many ten-and-sixpences as the impressions which might
be taken from the lithographic stones.

But he would not venture, without reserve, to make such an answer, if the example be taken
in horses, instead of pictures. The most dull economist would perceive, and admit, that a gentleman
who had a fine stud of horses was absolutely richer than one who had only ill-bred and broken-winded
ones. He would instinctively feel, though his pseudo-science had never taught him, that the
price paid for the animals, in either case, did not alter the fact of their worth: that the
good horse, though it might have been bought by chance for a few guineas, was not therefore
less valuable, nor the owner of the galled jade any the richer, because he had given a hundred
for it.

So that the economist, in saying that his science takes no account of the qualities of pictures,
merely signifies that he cannot conceive of any quality of essential badness or goodness existing
in pictures; and that he is incapable of investigating the laws of wealth in such articles.
Which is the fact. But, being incapable of defining intrinsic value in pictures, it follows
that he must be equally helpless to define the nature of intrinsic value in painted glass,
or in painted pottery, or in patterned stuffs, or in any other national produce requiring true
human ingenuity. Nay, though capable of conceiving the idea of intrinsic value with respect
to beasts of burden, no economist has endeavoured to state the general principles of National
Economy, even with regard to the horse or the ass. And, in fine, the modern political economists
have been, without exception, incapable of apprehending the nature of intrinsic value at all.

And the first specialty of the following treatise consists in its giving at the outset, and
maintaining as the foundation of all subsequent reasoning, a definition of Intrinsic Value,
and Intrinsic Contrary-of-Value; the negative power having been left by former writers entirely
out of account, and the positive power left entirely undefined.

But, secondly: the modern economist, ignoring intrinsic value, and accepting the popular estimate
of things as the only ground of his science, has imagined himself to have ascertained the constant
laws regulating the relation of this popular demand to its supply; or, at least, to have proved
that demand and supply were connected by heavenly balance, over which human foresight had no
power. I chanced, by singular coincidence, lately to see this theory of the law of demand and
supply brought to as sharp practical issue in another great siege, as I had seen the theories
of intrinsic value brought, in the siege of Venice.

I had the honour of being on the committee under the presidentship of the Lord Mayor of London,
for the victualling of Paris after her surrender. It became, at one period of our sittings,
a question of vital importance at what moment the law of demand and supply would come into
operation, and what the operation of it would exactly be: the demand, on this occasion, being
very urgent indeed; that of several millions of people within a few hours of utter starvation,
for any kind of food whatsoever. Nevertheless, it was admitted, in the course of debate, to
be probable that the divine principle of demand and supply might find itself at the eleventh
hour, and some minutes over, in want of carts and horses; and we ventured so far to interfere
with the divine principle as to provide carts and horses, with haste which proved, happily,
in time for the need; but not a moment in advance of it. It was farther recognized by the committee
that the divine principle of demand and supply would commence its operations by charging the
poor of Paris twelve-pence for a penny's worth of whatever they wanted; and would end its operations
by offering them twelve-pence worth for a penny, of whatever they didn't want. Whereupon it
was concluded by the committee that the tiny knot, on this special occasion, was scarcely "dignus
vindice," by the divine principle of demand and supply: and that we would venture, for once,
in a profane manner, to provide for the poor of Paris what they wanted, when they wanted it.
Which, to the value of the sums entrusted to us, it will be remembered we succeeded in doing.

But the fact is that the so-called "law," which was felt to be false in this case of extreme
exigence, is alike false in cases of less exigence. It is false always, and everywhere. Nay
to such an extent is its existence imaginary, that the vulgar economists are not even agreed
in their account of it; for some of them mean by it, only that prices are regulated by the
relation between demand and supply, which is partly true; and others mean that the relation
itself is one with the process of which it is unwise to interfere; a statement which is not
only, as in the above instance, untrue; but accurately the reverse of the truth: for all wise
economy, political or domestic, consists in the resolved maintenance of a given relation between
supply and demand, other than the instinctive, or (directly) natural, one.

Similarly, vulgar political economy asserts for a "law" that wages are determined by competition.

Now I pay my servants exactly what wages I think necessary to make them comfortable. The sum
is not determined at all by competition; but sometimes by my notions of their comfort and deserving,
and sometimes by theirs. If I were to become penniless to-morrow, several of them would certainly
still serve me for nothing.

In both the real and supposed cases the so-called "law" of vulgar political economy is absolutely
set at defiance. But I cannot set the law of gravitation at defiance, nor determine that in
my house I will not allow ice to melt, when the temperature is above thirty-two degrees. A
true law outside of my house, will remain a true one inside of it. It is not, therefore, a
law of Nature that wages are determined by competition. Still less is it a law of State, or
we should not now be disputing about it publicly, to the loss of many millions of pounds to
the country. The fact which vulgar economists have been weak enough to imagine a law, is only
that, for the last twenty years a number of very senseless persons have attempted to determine
wages in that manner; and have, in a measure, succeeded in occasionally doing so.

Both in definition of the elements of wealth, and in statement of the laws which govern its
distribution, modern political economy has been thus absolutely incompetent, or absolutely
false. And the following treatise is not, as it has been asserted with dull pertinacity, an
endeavour to put sentiment in the place of science; but it contains the exposure of what insolently
pretended to be a science; and the definition, hitherto unassailed--and I do not fear to assert,
unassailable--of the material elements with which political economy has to deal, and the moral
principles in which it consists; being not itself a science, but "a system of conduct founded
on the sciences, and impossible, except under certain conditions of moral culture." Which is
only to say, that industry, frugality, and discretion, the three foundations of economy, are
moral qualities, and cannot be attained without moral discipline: a flat truism, the reader
may think, thus stated, yet a truism which is denied both vociferously, and in all endeavour,
by the entire populace of Europe; who are at present hopeful of obtaining wealth by tricks
of trade, without industry; who, possessing wealth, have lost in the use of it even the conception,--how
much more the habit?--of frugality; and who, in the choice of the elements of wealth, cannot
so much as lose--since they have never hitherto at any time possessed,--the faculty of discretion.

Now if the teachers of the pseudo-science of economy had ventured to state distinctly even
the poor conclusions they had reached on the subjects respecting which it is most dangerous
for a populace to be indiscreet, they would have soon found, by the use made of them, which
were true, and which false.

But on main and vital questions, no political economist has hitherto ventured to state one
guiding principle. I will instance three subjects of universal importance. National Dress.
National Rent. National Debt.

Now if we are to look in any quarter for a systematic and exhaustive statement of the principles
of a given science, it must certainly be from its Professor at Cambridge.

Take the last edition of Professor Fawcett's Manual of Political Economy, and forming, first
clearly in your mind these three following questions, see if you can find an answer to them.

I. Does expenditure of capital on the production of luxurious dress and furniture tend to make
a nation rich or poor?

II. Does the payment, by the nation, of a tax on its land, or on the produce of it, to a certain
number of private persons, to be expended by them as they please, tend to make the nation rich
or poor?

III. Does the payment, by the nation, for an indefinite period, of interest on money borrowed
from private persons, tend to make the nation rich or poor?

These three questions are, all of them, perfectly simple, and primarily vital. Determine these,
and you have at once a basis for national conduct in all important particulars. Leave them
undetermined, and there is no limit to the distress which may be brought upon the people by
the cunning of its knaves, and the folly of its multitudes.

I will take the three in their order.

I. Dress. The general impression on the public mind at this day is, that the luxury of the
rich in dress and furniture is a benefit to the poor. Probably not even the blindest of our
political economists would venture to assert this in so many words. But where do they assert
the contrary? During the entire period of the reign of the late Emperor it was assumed in France,
as the first principle of fiscal government, that a large portion of the funds received as
rent from the provincial labourer should be expended in the manufacture of ladies' dresses
in Paris. Where is the political economist in France, or England, who ventured to assert the
conclusions of his science as adverse to this system? As early as the year 1857 I had done
my best to show the nature of the error, and to give warning of its danger;[7] but not one
of the men who had the foolish ears of the people intent on their words, dared to follow me
in speaking what would have been an offence to the powers of trade; and the powers of trade
in Paris had their full way for fourteen years more,--with this result, to-day,--as told us
in precise and curt terms by the Minister of Public Instruction,--[8]

     "We have replaced glory by gold, work by speculation, faith
     and honour by scepticism. To absolve or glorify immorality;
     to make much of loose women; to gratify our eyes with
     luxury, our ears with the tales of orgies; to aid in the
     manoeuvres of public robbers, or to applaud them; to laugh
     at morality, and only believe in success; to love nothing
     but pleasure, adore nothing but force; to replace work with
     a fecundity of fancies; to speak without thinking; to prefer
     noise to glory; to erect sneering into a system, and lying
     into an institution--is this the spectacle that we have
     seen?--is this the society that we have been?"

Of course, other causes, besides the desire of luxury in furniture and dress, have been at
work to produce such consequences; but the most active cause of all has been the passion for
these; passion unrebuked by the clergy, and, for the most part, provoked by economists, as
advantageous to commerce; nor need we think that such results have been arrived at in France
only; we are ourselves following rapidly on the same road. France, in her old wars with us,
never was so fatally our enemy as she has been in the fellowship of fashion, and the freedom
of trade: nor, to my mind, is any fact recorded of Assyrian or Roman luxury more ominous, or
ghastly, than one which came to my knowledge a few weeks ago, in England; a respectable and
well-to-do father and mother, in a quiet north country town, being turned into the streets
in their old age, at the suit of their only daughter's milliner.

II. Rent. The following account of the real nature of rent is given, quite accurately, by Professor
Fawcett, at page 112 of the last edition of his Political Economy:--

     "Every country has probably been subjugated, and grants of
     vanquished territory were the ordinary rewards which the
     conquering chief bestowed upon his more distinguished
     followers. Lands obtained by force had to be defended by
     force; and before law had asserted her supremacy, and
     property was made secure, no baron was able to retain his
     possessions, unless those who lived on his estates were
     prepared to defend them....[9] As property became secure,
     and landlords felt that the power of the State would protect
     them in all the rights of property, every vestige of these
     feudal tenures was abolished, and the relation between
     landlord and tenant has thus become purely commercial. A
     landlord offers his land to any one who is willing to take
     it; he is anxious to receive the highest rent he can obtain.
     What are the principles which regulate the rent which may
     thus be paid?"

These principles the Professor goes on contentedly to investigate, never appearing to contemplate
for an instant the possibility of the first principle in the whole business--the maintenance,
by force, of the possession of land obtained by force, being ever called in question by any
human mind. It is, nevertheless, the nearest task of our day to discover how far original theft
may be justly encountered by reactionary theft, or whether reactionary theft be indeed theft
at all; and farther, what, excluding either original or corrective theft, are the just conditions
of the possession of land.

III. Debt. Long since, when, a mere boy, I used to sit silently listening to the conversation
of the London merchants who, all of them good and sound men of business, were wont occasionally
to meet round my father's dining-table; nothing used to surprise me more than the conviction
openly expressed by some of the soundest and most cautious of them, that "if there were no
National debt they would not know what to do with their money, or where to place it safely."
At the 399th page of his Manual, you will find Professor Fawcett giving exactly the same statement.

     "In our own country, this certainty against risk of loss is
     provided by the public funds;"

and again, as on the question of rent, the Professor proceeds, without appearing for an instant
to be troubled by any misgiving that there may be an essential difference between the effects
on national prosperity of a Government paying interest on money which it spent in fire works
fifty years ago, and of a Government paying interest on money to be employed to-day on productive
labour.

That difference, which the reader will find stated and examined at length, in §§ 127-129 of
this volume, it is the business of economists, before approaching any other question relating
to government, fully to explain. And the paragraphs to which I refer, contain, I believe, the
only definite statement of it hitherto made.

The practical result of the absence of any such statement is, that capitalists, when they do
not know what to do with their money, persuade the peasants, in various countries, that the
said peasants want guns to shoot each other with. The peasants accordingly borrow guns, out
of the manufacture of which the capitalists get a per-centage, and men of science much amusement
and credit. Then the peasants shoot a certain number of each other, until they get tired; and
burn each other's homes down in various places. Then they put the guns back into towers, arsenals,
&c., in ornamental patterns; (and the victorious party put also some ragged flags in churches).
And then the capitalists tax both, annually, ever afterwards, to pay interest on the loan of
the guns and gunpowder. And that is what capitalists call "knowing what to do with their money;"
and what commercial men in general call "practical" as opposed to "sentimental" Political Economy.

Eleven years ago, in the summer of 1860, perceiving then fully, (as Carlyle had done long before),
what distress was about to come on the said populace of Europe through these errors of their
teachers, I began to do the best I might, to combat them, in the series of papers for the Cornhill
Magazine, since published under the title of Unto this Last. The editor of the Magazine was
my friend, and ventured the insertion of the three first essays; but the outcry against them
became then too strong for any editor to endure, and he wrote to me, with great discomfort
to himself, and many apologies to me, that the Magazine must only admit one Economical Essay more.

I made, with his permission, the last one longer than the rest, and gave it blunt conclusion
as well as I could--and so the book now stands; but, as I had taken not a little pains with
the Essays, and knew that they contained better work than most of my former writings, and more
important truths than all of them put together, this violent reprobation of them by the Cornhill
public set me still more gravely thinking; and, after turning the matter hither and thither
in my mind for two years more, I resolved to make it the central work of my life to write an
exhaustive treatise on Political Economy. It would not have been begun, at that time, however,
had not the editor of Fraser's Magazine written to me, saying that he believed there was something
in my theories, and would risk the admission of what I chose to write on this dangerous subject;
whereupon, cautiously, and at intervals, during the winter of 1862-63, I sent him, and he ventured
to print, the preface of the intended work, divided into four chapters. Then, though the Editor
had not wholly lost courage, the Publisher indignantly interfered; and the readers of Fraser,
as those of the Cornhill, were protected, for that time, from farther disturbance on my part.
Subsequently, loss of health, family distress, and various untoward chances, prevented my proceeding
with the body of the book;--seven years have passed ineffectually; and I am now fain to reprint
the Preface by itself, under the title which I intended for the whole.

Not discontentedly; being, at this time of life, resigned to the sense of failure; and also,
because the preface is complete in itself as a body of definitions, which I now require for
reference in the course of my Letters to Workmen; by which also, in time, I trust less formally
to accomplish the chief purpose of Munera Pulveris, practically summed in the two paragraphs
27 and 28: namely, to examine the moral results and possible rectifications of the laws of
distribution of wealth, which have prevailed hitherto without debate among men. Laws which
ordinary economists assume to be inviolable, and which ordinary socialists imagine to be on
the eve of total abrogation. But they are both alike deceived. The laws which at present regulate
the possession of wealth are unjust, because the motives which provoke to its attainment are
impure; but no socialism can effect their abrogation, unless it can abrogate also covetousness
and pride, which it is by no means yet in the way of doing. Nor can the change be, in any case,
to the extent that has been imagined. Extremes of luxury may be forbidden, and agony of penury
relieved; but nature intends, and the utmost efforts of socialism will not hinder the fulfilment
of her intention, that a provident person shall always be richer than a spendthrift; and an
ingenious one more comfortable than a fool. But, indeed, the adjustment of the possession of
the products of industry depends more on their nature than their quantity, and on wise determination
therefore of the aims of industry.

A nation which desires true wealth, desires it moderately, and can therefore distribute it
with kindness, and possess it with pleasure; but one which desires false wealth, desires it
immoderately, and can neither dispense it with justice, nor enjoy it in peace.

Therefore, needing, constantly in my present work, to refer to the definitions of true and
false wealth given in the following Essays, I republish them with careful revisal. They were
written abroad; partly at Milan, partly during a winter residence on the south-eastern slope
of the Mont Saléve, near Geneva; and sent to London in as legible MS. as I could write; but
I never revised the press sheets, and have been obliged, accordingly, now to amend the text
here and there, or correct it in unimportant particulars. Wherever any modification has involved
change in the sense, it is enclosed in square brackets; and what few explanatory comments I
have felt it necessary to add, have been indicated in the same manner. No explanatory comments,
I regret to perceive, will suffice to remedy the mischief of my affected concentration of language,
into the habit of which I fell by thinking too long over particular passages, in many and many
a solitary walk towards the mountains of Bonneville or Annecy. But I never intended the book
for anything else than a dictionary of reference, and that for earnest readers; who will, I
have good hope, if they find what they want in it, forgive the affectedly curt expressions.

The Essays, as originally published, were, as I have just stated, four in number. I have now,
more conveniently, divided the whole into six chapters; and (as I purpose throughout this edition
of my works) numbered the paragraphs.

I inscribed the first volume of this series to the friend who aided me in chief sorrow. Let
me inscribe the second to the friend and guide who has urged me to all chief labour, THOMAS
CARLYLE.

       *       *       *       *       *

I would that some better means were in my power of showing reverence to the man who alone,
of all our masters of literature, has written, without thought of himself, what he knew it
to be needful for the people of his time to hear, if the will to hear were in them: whom, therefore,
as the time draws near when his task must be ended, Republican and Free-thoughted England assaults
with impatient reproach; and out of the abyss of her cowardice in policy and dishonour in trade,
sets the hacks of her literature to speak evil, grateful to her ears, of the Solitary Teacher
who has asked her to be brave for the help of Man, and just, for the love of God.

CHAPTER I.

DEFINITIONS.

1. As domestic economy regulates the acts and habits of a household, Political economy regulates
those of a society or State, with reference to the means of its maintenance.

Political economy is neither an art nor a science; but a system of conduct and legislature,
founded on the sciences, directing the arts, and impossible, except under certain conditions
of moral culture.

2. The study which lately in England has been called Political Economy is in reality nothing
more than the investigation of some accidental phenomena of modern commercial operations, nor
has it been true in its investigation even of these. It has no connection whatever with political
economy, as understood and treated of by the great thinkers of past ages; and as long as its
unscholarly and undefined statements are allowed to pass under the same name, every word written
on the subject by those thinkers--and chiefly the words of Plato, Xenophon, Cicero and Bacon--must
be nearly useless to mankind. The reader must not, therefore, be surprised at the care and
insistance with which I have retained the literal and earliest sense of all important terms
used in these papers; for a word is usually well made at the time it is first wanted; its youngest
meaning has in it the full strength of its youth: subsequent senses are commonly warped or
weakened; and as all careful thinkers are sure to have used their words accurately, the first
condition, in order to be able to avail our selves of their sayings at all, is firm definition
of terms.

3. By the "maintenance" of a State is to be understood the support of its population in healthy
and happy life; and the increase of their numbers, so far as that increase is consistent with
their happiness. It is not the object of political economy to increase the numbers of a nation
at the cost of common health or comfort; nor to increase indefinitely the comfort of individuals,
by sacrifice of surrounding lives, or possibilities of life.

4. The assumption which lies at the root of nearly all erroneous reasoning on political economy,--namely,
that its object is to accumulate money or exchangeable property,--may be shown in a few words
to be without foundation. For no economist would admit national economy to be legitimate which
proposed to itself only the building of a pyramid of gold. He would declare the gold to be
wasted, were it to remain in the monumental form, and would say it ought to be employed. But
to what end? Either it must be used only to gain more gold, and build a larger pyramid, or
for some purpose other than the gaining of gold. And this other purpose, however at first apprehended,
will be found to resolve itself finally into the service of man;--that is to say, the extension,
defence, or comfort of his life. The golden pyramid may perhaps be providently built, perhaps
improvidently; but the wisdom or folly of the accumulation can only be determined by our having
first clearly stated the aim of all economy, namely, the extension of life.

If the accumulation of money, or of exchangeable property, were a certain means of extending
existence, it would be useless, in discussing economical questions, to fix our attention upon
the more distant object--life--instead of the immediate one--money. But it is not so. Money
may sometimes be accumulated at the cost of life, or by limitations of it; that is to say,
either by hastening the deaths of men, or preventing their births. It is therefore necessary
to keep clearly in view the ultimate object of economy; and to determine the expediency of
minor operations with reference to that ulterior end.

5. It has been just stated that the object of political economy is the continuance not only
of life, but of healthy and happy life. But all true happiness is both a consequence and cause
of life: it is a sign of its vigor, and source of its continuance. All true suffering is in
like manner a consequence and cause of death. I shall therefore, in future, use the word "Life"
singly: but let it be understood to include in its signification the happiness and power of
the entire human nature, body and soul.

6. That human nature, as its Creator made it, and maintains it wherever His laws are observed,
is entirely harmonious. No physical error can be more profound, no moral error more dangerous,
than that involved in the monkish doctrine of the opposition of body to soul. No soul can be
perfect in an imperfect body: no body perfect without perfect soul. Every right action and
true thought sets the seal of its beauty on person and face; every wrong action and foul thought
its seal of distortion; and the various aspects of humanity might be read as plainly as a printed
history, were it not that the impressions are so complex that it must always in some cases
(and, in the present state of our knowledge, in all cases) be impossible to decipher them completely.
Nevertheless, the face of a consistently just, and of a consistently unjust person, may always
be rightly distinguished at a glance; and if the qualities are continued by descent through
a generation or two, there arises a complete distinction of race. Both moral and physical qualities
are communicated by descent, far more than they can be developed by education; (though both
may be destroyed by want of education), and there is as yet no ascertained limit to the nobleness
of person and mind which the human creature may attain, by persevering observance of the laws
of God respecting its birth and training.

7. We must therefore yet farther define the aim of political economy to be "The multiplication
of human life at the highest standard." It might at first seem questionable whether we should
endeavour to maintain a small number of persons of the highest type of beauty and intelligence,
or a larger number of an inferior class. But I shall be able to show in the sequel, that the
way to maintain the largest number is first to aim at the highest standard. Determine the noblest
type of man, and aim simply at maintaining the largest possible number of persons of that class,
and it will be found that the largest possible number of every healthy subordinate class must
necessarily be produced also.

8. The perfect type of manhood, as just stated, involves the perfections (whatever we may hereafter
determine these to be) of his body, affections, and intelligence. The material things, therefore,
which it is the object of political economy to produce and use, (or accumulate for use,) are
things which serve either to sustain and comfort the body, or exercise rightly the affections
and form the intelligence.[10] Whatever truly serves either of these purposes is "useful" to
man, wholesome, healthful, helpful, or holy. By seeking such things, man prolongs and increases
his life upon the earth.

On the other hand, whatever does not serve either of these purposes,--much more whatever counteracts
them,--is in like manner useless to man, unwholesome, unhelpful, or unholy; and by seeking
such things man shortens and diminishes his life upon the earth.

9. And neither with respect to things useful or useless can man's estimate of them alter their
nature. Certain substances being good for his food, and others noxious to him, what he thinks
or wishes respecting them can neither change, nor prevent, their power. If he eats corn, he
will live; if nightshade, he will die. If he produce or make good and beautiful things, they
will Re-Create him; (note the solemnity and weight of the word); if bad and ugly things, they
will "corrupt" or "break in pieces"--that is, in the exact degree of their power, Kill him.
For every hour of labour, however enthusiastic or well intended, which he spends for that which
is not bread, so much possibility of life is lost to him. His fancies, likings, beliefs, however
brilliant, eager, or obstinate, are of no avail if they are set on a false object. Of all that
he has laboured for, the eternal law of heaven and earth measures out to him for reward, to
the utmost atom, that part which he ought to have laboured for, and withdraws from him (or
enforces on him, it may be) inexorably, that part which he ought not to have laboured for until,
on his summer threshing-floor, stands his heap of corn; little or much, not according to his
labour, but to his discretion. No "commercial arrangements," no painting of surfaces, nor alloying
of substances, will avail him a pennyweight. Nature asks of him calmly and inevitably, What
have you found, or formed--the right thing or the wrong? By the right thing you shall live;
by the wrong you shall die.

10. To thoughtless persons it seems otherwise. The world looks to them as if they could cozen
it out of some ways and means of life. But they cannot cozen IT: they can only cozen their
neighbours. The world is not to be cheated of a grain; not so much as a breath of its air can
be drawn surreptitiously. For every piece of wise work done, so much life is granted; for every
piece of foolish work, nothing; for every piece of wicked work, so much death is allotted.
This is as sure as the courses of day and night. But when the means of life are once produced,
men, by their various struggles and industries of accumulation or exchange, may variously gather,
waste, restrain, or distribute them; necessitating, in proportion to the waste or restraint,
accurately, so much more death. The rate and range of additional death are measured by the
rate and range of waste; and are inevitable;--the only question (determined mostly by fraud
in peace, and force in war) is, Who is to die, and how?

11. Such being the everlasting law of human existence, the essential work of the political
economist is to determine what are in reality useful or life-giving things, and by what degrees
and kinds of labour they are attainable and distributable. This investigation divides itself
under three great heads;--the studies, namely, of the phenomena, first, of WEALTH; secondly,
of MONEY; and thirdly, of RICHES.

These terms are often used as synonymous, but they signify entirely different things. "Wealth"
consists of things in themselves valuable; "Money," of documentary claims to the possession
of such things; and "Riches" is a relative term, expressing the magnitude of the possessions
of one person or society as compared with those of other persons or societies.

The study of Wealth is a province of natural science:--it deals with the essential properties
of things.

The study of Money is a province of commercial science:--it deals with conditions of engagement
and exchange.

The study of Riches is a province of moral science:--it deals with the due relations of men
to each other in regard of material possessions; and with the just laws of their association
for purposes of labour.

I shall in this first chapter shortly sketch out the range of subjects which will come before
us as we follow these three branches of inquiry.

12. And first of WEALTH, which, it has been said, consists of things essentially valuable.
We now, therefore, need a definition of "value."

"Value" signifies the strength, or "availing" of anything towards the sustaining of life, and
is always twofold; that is to say, primarily, INTRINSIC, and secondarily, EFFECTUAL.

The reader must, by anticipation, be warned against confusing value with cost, or with price.
Value is the life-giving power of anything; cost, the quantity of labour required to produce
it; price, the quantity of labour which its possessor will take in exchange for it.[11] Cost
and price are commercial conditions, to be studied under the head of money.

13. Intrinsic value is the absolute power of anything to support life. A sheaf of wheat of
given quality and weight has in it a measurable power of sustaining the substance of the body;
a cubic foot of pure air, a fixed power of sustaining its warmth; and a cluster of flowers
of given beauty a fixed power of enlivening or animating the senses and heart.

It does not in the least affect the intrinsic value of the wheat, the air, or the flowers,
that men refuse or despise them. Used or not, their own power is in them, and that particular
power is in nothing else.

14. But in order that this value of theirs may become effectual, a certain state is necessary
in the recipient of it. The digesting, breathing, and perceiving functions must be perfect
in the human creature before the food, air, or flowers can become of their full value to it.
The production of effectual value, therefore, always involves two needs: first, the production
of a thing essentially useful; then the production of the capacity to use it. Where the intrinsic
value and acceptant capacity come together there is Effectual value, or wealth; where there
is either no intrinsic value, or no acceptant capacity, there is no effectual value; that is
to say, no wealth. A horse is no wealth to us if we cannot ride, nor a picture if we cannot
see, nor can any noble thing be wealth, except to a noble person. As the aptness of the user
increases, the effectual value of the thing used increases; and in its entirety can co-exist
only with perfect skill of use, and fitness of nature.

15. Valuable material things may be conveniently referred to five heads:

(i.) Land, with its associated air, water, and organisms.

(ii.) Houses, furniture, and instruments.

(iii.) Stored or prepared food, medicine, and articles of bodily luxury, including clothing.

(iv.) Books.

(v.) Works of art.

The conditions of value in these things are briefly as follows:--

16. (i.) Land. Its value is twofold; first, as producing food and mechanical power; secondly,
as an object of sight and thought, producing intellectual power.

Its value, as a means of producing food and mechanical power, varies with its form (as mountain
or plain), with its substance (in soil or mineral contents), and with its climate. All these
conditions of intrinsic value must be known and complied with by the men who have to deal with
it, in order to give effectual value; but at any given time and place, the intrinsic value
is fixed: such and such a piece of land, with its associated lakes and seas, rightly treated
in surface and substance, can produce precisely so much food and power, and no more.

The second element of value in land being its beauty, united with such conditions of space
and form as are necessary for exercise, and for fullness of animal life, land of the highest
value in these respects will be that lying in temperate climates, and boldly varied in form;
removed from unhealthy or dangerous influences (as of miasm or volcano); and capable of sustaining
a rich fauna and flora. Such land, carefully tended by the hand of man, so far as to remove
from it unsightlinesses and evidences of decay, guarded from violence, and inhabited, under
man's affectionate protection, by every kind of living creature that can occupy it in peace,
is the most precious "property" that human beings can possess.

17. (ii.) Buildings, furniture, and instruments.

The value of buildings consists, first, in permanent strength, with convenience of form, of
size, and of position; so as to render employment peaceful, social intercourse easy, temperature
and air healthy. The advisable or possible magnitude of cities and mode of their distribution
in squares, streets, courts, &c.; the relative value of sites of land, and the modes of structure
which are healthiest and most permanent, have to be studied under this head.

The value of buildings consists secondly in historical association, and architectural beauty,
of which we have to examine the influence on manners and life.

The value of instruments consists, first, in their power of shortening labour, or otherwise
accomplishing what human strength unaided could not. The kinds of work which are severally
best accomplished by hand or by machine;--the effect of machinery in gathering and multiplying
population, and its influence on the minds and bodies of such population; together with the
conceivable uses of machinery on a colossal scale in accomplishing mighty and useful works,
hitherto unthought of, such as the deepening of large river channels;--changing the surface
of mountainous districts;--irrigating tracts of desert in the torrid zone;--breaking up, and
thus rendering capable of quicker fusion, edges of ice in the northern and southern Arctic
seas, &c., so rendering parts of the earth habitable which hitherto have been lifeless, are
to be studied under this head.

The value of instruments is, secondarily, in their aid to abstract sciences. The degree in
which the multiplication of such instruments should be encouraged, so as to make them, if large,
easy of access to numbers (as costly telescopes), or so cheap as that they might, in a serviceable
form, become a common part of the furniture of households, is to be considered under this head.[12]

18. (iii.) Food, medicine, and articles of luxury. Under this head we shall have to examine
the possible methods of obtaining pure food in such security and equality of supply as to avoid
both waste and famine: then the economy of medicine and just range of sanitary law: finally
the economy of luxury, partly an æsthetic and partly an ethical question.

19. (iv.) Books. The value of these consists,

First, in their power of preserving and communicating the knowledge of facts.

Secondly, in their power of exciting vital or noble emotion and intellectual action. They have
also their corresponding negative powers of disguising and effacing the memory of facts, and
killing the noble emotions, or exciting base ones. Under these two heads we have to consider
the economical and educational value, positive and negative, of literature;--the means of producing
and educating good authors, and the means and advisability of rendering good books generally
accessible, and directing the reader's choice to them.

20. (v.) Works of art. The value of these is of the same nature as that of books; but the laws
of their production and possible modes of distribution are very different, and require separate
examination.

21. II.--MONEY. Under this head, we shall have to examine the laws of currency and exchange;
of which I will note here the first principles.

Money has been inaccurately spoken of as merely a means of exchange. But it is far more than
this. It is a documentary expression of legal claim. It is not wealth, but a documentary claim
to wealth, being the sign of the relative quantities of it, or of the labour producing it,
to which, at a given time, persons, or societies, are entitled.

If all the money in the world, notes and gold, were destroyed in an instant, it would leave
the world neither richer nor poorer than it was. But it would leave the individual inhabitants
of it in different relations.

Money is, therefore, correspondent in its nature to the title-deed of an estate. Though the
deed be burned, the estate still exists, but the right to it has become disputable.

22. The real worth of money remains unchanged, as long as the proportion of the quantity of
existing money to the quantity of existing wealth or available labour remains unchanged.

If the wealth increases, but not the money, the worth of the money increases; if the money
increases, but not the wealth, the worth of the money diminishes.

23. Money, therefore, cannot be arbitrarily multiplied, any more than title-deeds can. So long
as the existing wealth or available labour is not fully represented by the currency, the currency
may be increased without diminution of the assigned worth of its pieces. But when the existing
wealth, or available labour is once fully represented, every piece of money thrown into circulation
diminishes the worth of every other existing piece, in the proportion it bears to the number
of them, provided the new piece be received with equal credit; if not, the depreciation of
worth takes place, according to the degree of its credit.

24. When, however, new money, composed of some substance of supposed intrinsic value (as of
gold), is brought into the market, or when new notes are issued which are supposed to be deserving
of credit, the desire to obtain the money will, under certain circumstances, stimulate industry:
an additional quantity of wealth is immediately produced, and if this be in proportion to the
new claims advanced, the value of the existing currency is undepreciated. If the stimulus given
be so great as to produce more goods than are proportioned to the additional coinage, the worth
of the existing currency will be raised.

Arbitrary control and issues of currency affect the production of wealth, by acting on the
hopes and fears of men, and are, under certain circumstances, wise. But the issue of additional
currency to meet the exigencies of immediate expense, is merely one of the disguised forms
of borrowing or taxing. It is, however, in the present low state of economical knowledge, often
possible for governments to venture on an issue of currency, when they could not venture on
an additional loan or tax, because the real operation of such issue is not understood by the
people, and the pressure of it is irregularly distributed, and with an unperceived gradation.

25. The use of substances of intrinsic value as the materials of a currency, is a barbarism;--a
remnant of the conditions of barter, which alone render commerce possible among savage nations.
It is, however, still necessary, partly as a mechanical check on arbitrary issues; partly as
a means of exchanges with foreign nations. In proportion to the extension of civilization,
and increase of trustworthiness in Governments, it will cease. So long as it exists, the phenomena
of the cost and price of the articles used for currency are mingled with those proper to currency
itself, in an almost inextricable manner: and the market worth of bullion is affected by multitudinous
accidental circumstances, which have been traced, with more or less success, by writers on
commercial operations: but with these variations the true political economist has no more to
do than an engineer, fortifying a harbour of refuge against Atlantic tide, has to concern himself
with the cries or quarrels of children who dig pools with their fingers for its streams among
the sand.

26. III.--RICHES. According to the various industry, capacity, good fortune, and desires of
men, they obtain greater or smaller share of, and claim upon, the wealth of the world.

The inequalities between these shares, always in some degree just and necessary, may be either
restrained by law or circumstance within certain limits; or may increase indefinitely.

Where no moral or legal restraint is put upon the exercise of the will and intellect of the
stronger, shrewder, or more covetous men, these differences become ultimately enormous. But
as soon as they become so distinct in their extremes as that, on one side, there shall be manifest
redundance of possession, and on the other manifest pressure of need,--the terms "riches" and
"poverty" are used to express the opposite states; being contrary only as the terms "warmth"
and "cold" are contraries, of which neither implies an actual degree, but only a relation to
other degrees, of temperature.

27. Respecting riches, the economist has to inquire, first, into the advisable modes of their
collection; secondly, into the advisable modes of their administration.

Respecting the collection of national riches, he has to inquire, first, whether he is justified
in calling the nation rich, if the quantity of wealth it possesses relatively to the wealth
of other nations, be large; irrespectively of the manner of its distribution. Or does the mode
of distribution in any wise affect the nature of the riches? Thus, if the king alone be rich--suppose
Croesus or Mausolus--are the Lydians or Carians therefore a rich nation? Or if a few slave-masters
are rich, and the nation is otherwise composed of slaves, is it to be called a rich nation?
For if not, and the ideas of a certain mode of distribution or operation in the riches, and
of a certain degree of freedom in the people, enter into our idea of riches as attributed to
a people, we shall have to define the degree of fluency, or circulative character which is
essential to the nature of common wealth; and the degree of independence of action required
in its possessors. Questions which look as if they would take time in answering.[13]

28. And farther. Since the inequality, which is the condition of riches, may be established
in two opposite modes--namely, by increase of possession on the one side, and by decrease of
it on the other--we have to inquire, with respect to any given state of riches, precisely in
what manner the correlative poverty was produced: that is to say, whether by being surpassed
only, or being depressed also; and if by being depressed, what are the advantages, or the contrary,
conceivable in the depression. For instance, it being one of the commonest advantages of being
rich to entertain a number of servants, we have to inquire, on the one side, what economical
process produced the riches of the master; and on the other, what economical process produced
the poverty of the persons who serve him; and what advantages each, on his own side, derives
from the result.

29. These being the main questions touching the collection of riches, the next, or last, part
of the inquiry is into their administration.

Their possession involves three great economical powers which require separate examination:
namely, the powers of selection, direction, and provision.

The power of SELECTION relates to things of which the supply is limited (as the supply of best
things is always). When it becomes matter of question to whom such things are to belong, the
richest person has necessarily the first choice, unless some arbitrary mode of distribution
be otherwise determined upon. The business of the economist is to show how this choice may
be a wise one.

The power of DIRECTION arises out of the necessary relation of rich men to poor, which ultimately,
in one way or another, involves the direction of, or authority over, the labour of the poor;
and this nearly as much over their mental as their bodily labour. The business of the economist
is to show how this direction may be a Just one.

The power of PROVISION is dependent upon the redundance of wealth, which may of course by active
persons be made available in preparation for future work or future profit; in which function
riches have generally received the name of capital; that is to say, of head-, or source-material.
The business of the economist is to show how this provision may be a Distant one.

30. The examination of these three functions of riches will embrace every final problem of
political economy;--and, above, or before all, this curious and vital problem,--whether, since
the wholesome action of riches in these three functions will depend (it appears), on the Wisdom,
Justice, and Farsightedness of the holders; and it is by no means to be assumed that persons
primarily rich, must therefore be just and wise,--it may not be ultimately possible so, or
somewhat so, to arrange matters, as that persons primarily just and wise, should therefore be rich?

Such being the general plan of the inquiry before us, I shall not limit myself to any consecutive
following of it, having hardly any good hope of being able to complete so laborious a work
as it must prove to me; but from time to time, as I have leisure, shall endeavour to carry
forward this part or that, as may be immediately possible; indicating always with accuracy
the place which the particular essay will or should take in the completed system.

of it, was written. The gist of it is, that the first of all inquiries respecting the wealth
of any nation is not, how much it has; but whether it is in a form that can be used, and in
the possession of persons who can use it.]

CHAPTER II.

STORE-KEEPING.

31. The first chapter having consisted of little more than definition of terms, I purpose,
in this, to expand and illustrate the given definitions.

The view which has here been taken of the nature of wealth, namely, that it consists in an
intrinsic value developed by a vital power, is directly opposed to two nearly universal conceptions
of wealth. In the assertion that value is primarily intrinsic, it opposes the idea that anything
which is an object of desire to numbers, and is limited in quantity, so as to have rated worth
in exchange, may be called, or virtually become, wealth. And in the assertion that value is,
secondarily, dependent upon power in the possessor, it opposes the idea that the worth of things
depends on the demand for them, instead of on the use of them. Before going farther, we will
make these two positions clearer.

32. I. First. All wealth is intrinsic, and is not constituted by the judgment of men. This
is easily seen in the case of things affecting the body; we know, that no force of fantasy
will make stones nourishing, or poison innocent; but it is less apparent in things affecting
the mind. We are easily--perhaps willingly--misled by the appearance of beneficial results
obtained by industries addressed wholly to the gratification of fanciful desire; and apt to
suppose that whatever is widely coveted, dearly bought, and pleasurable in possession, must
be included in our definition of wealth. It is the more difficult to quit ourselves of this
error because many things which are true wealth in moderate use, become false wealth in immoderate;
and many things are mixed of good and evil,--as mostly, books, and works of art,--out of which
one person Will get the good, and another the evil; so that it seems as if there were no fixed
good or evil in the things themselves, but only in the view taken, and use made of them.

But that is not so. The evil and good are fixed; in essence, and in proportion. And in things
in which evil depends upon excess, the point of excess, though indefinable, is fixed; and the
power of the thing is on the hither side for good, and on the farther side for evil. And in
all cases this power is inherent, not dependent on opinion or choice. Our thoughts of things
neither make, nor mar their eternal force; nor--which is the most serious point for future
consideration--can they prevent the effect of it (within certain limits) upon ourselves.

33. Therefore, the object of any special analysis of wealth will be not so much to enumerate
what is serviceable, as to distinguish what is destructive; and to show that it is inevitably
destructive; that to receive pleasure from an evil thing is not to escape from, or alter the
evil of it, but to be altered by it; that is, to suffer from it to the utmost, having our own
nature, in that degree, made evil also. And it may be shown farther, that, through whatever
length of time or subtleties of connexion the harm is accomplished, (being also less or more
according to the fineness and worth of the humanity on which it is wrought), still, nothing
but harm ever comes of a bad thing.

34. So that, in sum, the term wealth is never to be attached to the accidental object of a
morbid desire, but only to the constant object of a legitimate one.[14] By the fury of ignorance,
and fitfulness of caprice, large interests may be continually attached to things unserviceable
or hurtful; if their nature could be altered by our passions, the science of Political Economy
would remain, what it has been hitherto among us, the weighing of clouds, and the portioning
out of shadows. But of ignorance there is no science; and of caprice no law. Their disturbing
forces interfere with the operations of faithful Economy, but have nothing in common with them:
she, the calm arbiter of national destiny, regards only essential power for good in all that
she accumulates, and alike disdains the wanderings[15] of imagination, and the thirsts of disease.

35. II. Secondly. The assertion that wealth is not only intrinsic, but dependent, in order
to become effectual, on a given degree of vital power in its possessor, is opposed to another
popular view of wealth;--namely, that though it may always be constituted by caprice, it is,
when so constituted, a substantial thing, of which given quantities may be counted as existing
here, or there, and exchangeable at rated prices.

In this view there are three errors. The first and chief is the overlooking the fact that all
exchangeableness of commodity, or effective demand for it, depends on the sum of capacity for
its use existing, here or elsewhere. The book we cannot read, or picture we take no delight
in, may indeed be called part of our wealth, in so far as we have power of exchanging either
for something we like better. But our power of effecting such exchange, and yet more, of effecting
it to advantage, depends absolutely on the number of accessible persons who can understand
the book, or enjoy the painting, and who will dispute the possession of them. Thus the actual
worth of either, even to us, depends no more on their essential goodness than on the capacity
existing somewhere for the perception of it; and it is vain in any completed system of production
to think of obtaining one without the other. So that, though the true political economist knows
that co-existence of capacity for use with temporary possession cannot be always secured, the
final fact, on which he bases all action and administration, is that, in the whole nation,
or group of nations, he has to deal with, for every atom of intrinsic value produced he must
with exactest chemistry produce its twin atom of acceptant digestion, or understanding capacity;
or, in the degree of his failure, he has no wealth. Nature's challenge to us is, in earnest,
as the Assyrians mock; "I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to
set riders upon them." Bavieca's paces are brave, if the Cid backs him; but woe to us, if we
take the dust of capacity, wearing the armour of it, for capacity itself, for so all procession,
however goodly in the show of it, is to the tomb.

36. The second error in this popular view of wealth is, that in giving the name of wealth to
things which we cannot use, we in reality confuse wealth with money. The land we have no skill
to cultivate, the book which is sealed to us, or dress which is superfluous, may indeed be
exchangeable, but as such are nothing more than a cumbrous form of bank-note, of doubtful or
slow convertibility. As long as we retain possession of them, we merely keep our bank-notes
in the shape of gravel or clay, of book-leaves, or of embroidered tissue. Circumstances may,
perhaps, render such forms the safest, or a certain complacency may attach to the exhibition
of them; into both these advantages we shall inquire afterwards; I wish the reader only to
observe here, that exchangeable property which we cannot use is, to us personally, merely one
of the forms of money, not of wealth.

37. The third error in the popular view is the confusion of Guardianship with Possession; the
real state of men of property being, too commonly, that of curators, not possessors, of wealth.

A man's power over his property is at the widest range of it, fivefold; it is power of Use,
for himself, Administration, to others, Ostentation, Destruction, or Bequest: and possession
is in use only, which for each man is sternly limited; so that such things, and so much of
them as he can use, are, indeed, well for him, or Wealth; and more of them, or any other things,
are ill for him, or Illth.[16] Plunged to the lips in Orinoco, he shall drink to his thirst
measure; more, at his peril: with a thousand oxen on his lands, he shall eat to his hunger
measure; more, at his peril. He cannot live in two houses at once; a few bales of silk or wool
will suffice for the fabric of all the clothes he can ever wear, and a few books will probably
hold all the furniture good for his brain. Beyond these, in the best of us but narrow, capacities,
we have but the power of administering, or mal-administering, wealth: (that is to say, distributing,
lending, or increasing it);--of exhibiting it (as in magnificence of retinue or furniture),--of
destroying, or, finally, of bequeathing it. And with multitudes of rich men, administration
degenerates into curatorship; they merely hold their property in charge, as Trustees, for the
benefit of some person or persons to whom it is to be delivered upon their death; and the position,
explained in clear terms, would hardly seem a covetable one. What would be the probable feelings
of a youth, on his entrance into life, to whom the career hoped for him was proposed in terms
such as these: "You must work unremittingly, and with your utmost intelligence, during all
your available years, you will thus accumulate wealth to a large amount; but you must touch
none of it, beyond what is needful for your support. Whatever sums you gain, beyond those required
for your decent and moderate maintenance, and whatever beautiful things you may obtain possession
of, shall be properly taken care of by servants, for whose maintenance you will be charged,
and whom you will have the trouble of superintending, and on your deathbed you shall have the
power of determining to whom the accumulated property shall belong, or to what purposes be
applied."

38. The labour of life, under such conditions, would probably be neither zealous nor cheerful;
yet the only difference between this position and that of the ordinary capitalist is the power
which the latter supposes himself to possess, and which is attributed to him by others, of
spending his money at any moment. This pleasure, taken in the imagination of power to part
with that with which we have no intention of parting, is one of the most curious, though commonest
forms of the Eidolon, or Phantasm of Wealth. But the political economist has nothing to do
with this idealism, and looks only to the practical issue of it--namely, that the holder of
wealth, in such temper, may be regarded simply as a mechanical means of collection; or as a
money-chest with a slit in it, not only receptant but suctional, set in the public thoroughfare;--chest
of which only Death has the key, and evil Chance the distribution of the contents. In his function
of Lender (which, however, is one of administration, not use, as far as he is himself concerned),
the capitalist takes, indeed, a more interesting aspect; but even in that function, his relations
with the state are apt to degenerate into a mechanism for the convenient contraction of debt;--a
function the more mischievous, because a nation invariably appeases its conscience with respect
to an unjustifiable expense, by meeting it with borrowed funds, expresses its repentance of
a foolish piece of business, by letting its tradesmen wait for their money, and always leaves
its descendants to pay for the work which will be of the least advantage to them.[17]

39. Quit of these three sources of misconception, the reader will have little farther difficulty
in apprehending the real nature of Effectual value. He may, however, at first not without surprise,
perceive the consequences involved in his acceptance of the definition. For if the actual existence
of wealth be dependent on the power of its possessor, it follows that the sum of wealth held
by the nation, instead of being constant, or calculable, varies hourly, nay, momentarily, with
the number and character of its holders! and that in changing hands, it changes in quantity.
And farther, since the worth of the currency is proportioned to the sum of material wealth
which it represents, if the sum of the wealth changes, the worth of the currency changes. And
thus both the sum of the property, and power of the currency, of the state, vary momentarily
as the character and number of the holders. And not only so, but different rates and kinds
of variation are caused by the character of the holders of different kinds of wealth. The transitions
of value caused by the character of the holders of land differ in mode from those caused by
character in holders of works of art; and these again from those caused by character in holders
of machinery or other working capital. But we cannot examine these special phenomena of any
kind of wealth until we have a clear idea of the way in which true currency expresses them;
and of the resulting modes in which the cost and price of any article are related to its value.
To obtain this we must approach the subject in its first elements.

40. Let us suppose a national store of wealth, composed of material things either useful, or
believed to be so, taken charge of by the Government,[18] and that every workman, having produced
any article involving labour in its production, and for which he has no immediate use, brings
it to add to this store, receiving from the Government, in exchange, an order either for the
return of the thing itself, or of its equivalent in other things, such as he may choose out
of the store, at any time when he needs them. The question of equivalence itself (how much
wine a man is to receive in return for so much corn, or how much coal in return for so much
iron) is a quite separate one, which we will examine presently. For the time, let it be assumed
that this equivalence has been determined, and that the Government order, in exchange for a
fixed weight of any article (called, suppose a), is either for the return of that weight of
the article itself, or of another fixed weight of the article b, or another of the article
c, and so on.

Now, supposing that the labourer speedily and continually presents these general orders, or,
in common language, "spends the money," he has neither changed the circumstances of the nation,
nor his own, except in so far as he may have produced useful and consumed useless articles,
or vice versâ. But if he does not use, or uses in part only, the orders he receives, and lays
aside some portion of them; and thus every day bringing his contribution to the national store,
lays by some per-centage of the orders received in exchange for it, he increases the national
wealth daily by as much as he does not use of the received order, and to the same amount accumulates
a monetary claim on the Government. It is, of course, always in his power, as it is his legal
right, to bring forward this accumulation of claim, and at once to consume, destroy, or distribute,
the sum of his wealth. Supposing he never does so, but dies, leaving his claim to others, he
has enriched the State during his life by the quantity of wealth over which that claim extends,
or has, in other words, rendered so much additional life possible in the State, of which additional
life he bequeaths the immediate possibility to those whom he invests with his claim. Supposing
him to cancel the claim, he would distribute this possibility of life among the nation at large.

41. We hitherto consider the Government itself as simply a conservative power, taking charge
of the wealth entrusted to it.

But a Government may be more or less than a conservative power. It may be either an improving,
or destructive one.

If it be an improving power, using all the wealth entrusted to it to the best advantage, the
nation is enriched in root and branch at once, and the Government is enabled, for every order
presented, to return a quantity of wealth greater than the order was written for, according
to the fructification obtained in the interim. This ability may be either concealed, in which
case the currency does not completely represent the wealth of the country, or it may be manifested
by the continual payment of the excess of value on each order, in which case there is (irrespectively,
observe, of collateral results afterwards to be examined) a perpetual rise in the worth of
the currency, that is to say, a fall in the price of all articles represented by it.

42. But if the Government be destructive, or a consuming power, it becomes unable to return
the value received on the presentation of the order.

This inability may either be concealed by meeting demands to the full, until it issue in bankruptcy,
or in some form of national debt;--or it may be concealed during oscillatory movements between
destructiveness and productiveness, which result on the whole in stability;--or it may be manifested
by the consistent return of less than value received on each presented order, in which case
there is a consistent fall in the worth of the currency, or rise in the price of the things
represented by it.

43. Now, if for this conception of a central Government, we substitute that of a body of persons
occupied in industrial pursuits, of whom each adds in his private capacity to the common store,
we at once obtain an approximation to the actual condition of a civilized mercantile community,
from which approximation we might easily proceed into still completer analysis. I purpose,
however, to arrive at every result by the gradual expansion of the simpler conception; but
I wish the reader to observe, in the meantime, that both the social conditions thus supposed
(and I will by anticipation say also, all possible social conditions), agree in two great points;
namely, in the primal importance of the supposed national store or stock, and in its destructibility
or improveability by the holders of it.

44. I. Observe that in both conditions, that of central Government-holding, and diffused private-holding,
the quantity of stock is of the same national moment. In the one case, indeed, its amount may
be known by examination of the persons to whom it is confided; in the other it cannot be known
but by exposing the private affairs of every individual. But, known or unknown, its significance
is the same under each condition. The riches of the nation consist in the abundance, and their
wealth depends on the nature, of this store.

45. II. In the second place, both conditions, (and all other possible ones) agree in the destructibility
or improveability of the store by its holders. Whether in private hands, or under Government
charge, the national store may be daily consumed, or daily enlarged, by its possessors; and
while the currency remains apparently unaltered, the property it represents may diminish or
increase.

46. The first question, then, which we have to put under our simple conception of central Government,
namely, "What store has it?" is one of equal importance, whatever may be the constitution of
the State; while the second question--namely, "Who are the holders of the store?" involves
the discussion of the constitution of the State itself.

The first inquiry resolves itself into three heads:

1. What is the nature of the store?

2. What is its quantity in relation to the population?

3. What is its quantity in relation to the currency?

The second inquiry into two:

1. Who are the Holders of the store, and in what proportions?

2. Who are the Claimants of the store, (that is to say, the holders of the currency,) and in
what proportions?

We will examine the range of the first three questions in the present paper; of the two following,
in the sequel.

47. I. QUESTION FIRST. What is the nature of the store? Has the nation hitherto worked for
and gathered the right thing or the wrong? On that issue rest the possibilities of its life.

For example, let us imagine a society, of no great extent, occupied in procuring and laying
up store of corn, wine, wool, silk, and other such preservable materials of food and clothing;
and that it has a currency representing them. Imagine farther, that on days of festivity, the
society, discovering itself to derive satisfaction from pyrotechnics, gradually turns its attention
more and more to the manufacture of gunpowder; so that an increasing number of labourers, giving
what time they can spare to this branch of industry, bring increasing quantities of combustibles
into the store, and use the general orders received in exchange to obtain such wine, wool,
or corn, as they may have need of. The currency remains the same, and represents precisely
the same amount of material in the store, and of labour spent in producing it. But the corn
and wine gradually vanish, and in their place, as gradually, appear sulphur and saltpetre,
till at last the labourers who have consumed corn and supplied nitre, presenting on a festal
morning some of their currency to obtain materials for the feast, discover that no amount of
currency will command anything Festive, except Fire. The supply of rockets is unlimited, but
that of food, limited, in a quite final manner; and the whole currency in the hands of the
society represents an infinite power of detonation, but none of existence.

48. This statement, caricatured as it may seem, is only exaggerated in assuming the persistence
of the folly to extremity, unchecked, as in reality it would be, by the gradual rise in price
of food. But it falls short of the actual facts of human life in expression of the depth and
intensity of the folly itself. For a great part (the reader would not believe how great until
he saw the statistics in detail) of the most earnest and ingenious industry of the world is
spent in producing munitions of war; gathering, that is to say the materials, not of festive,
but of consuming fire; filling its stores with all power of the instruments of pain, and all
affluence of the ministries of death. It was no true Trionfo della Morte[19] which men have
seen and feared (sometimes scarcely feared) so long; wherein he brought them rest from their
labours. We see, and share, another and higher form of his triumph now. Task-master, instead
of Releaser, he rules the dust of the arena no less than of the tomb; and, content once in
the grave whither man went, to make his works to cease and his devices to vanish,--now, in
the busy city and on the serviceable sea, makes his work to increase, and his devices to multiply.

49. To this doubled loss, or negative power of labour, spent in producing means of destruction,
we have to add, in our estimate of the consequences of human folly, whatever more insidious
waste of toil there is in production of unnecessary luxury. Such and such an occupation (it
is said) supports so many labourers, because so many obtain wages in following it; but it is
never considered that unless there be a supporting power in the product of the occupation,
the wages given to one man are merely withdrawn from another. We cannot say of any trade that
it maintains such and such a number of persons, unless we know how and where the money, now
spent in the purchase of its produce, would have been spent, if that produce had not been manufactured.
The purchasing funds truly support a number of people in making This; but (probably) leave
unsupported an equal number who are making, or could have made That. The manufacturers of small
watches thrive at Geneva;--it is well;--but where would the money spent on small watches have
gone, had there been no small watches to buy?

50. If the so frequently uttered aphorism of mercantile economy--"labour is limited by capital,"
were true, this question would be a definite one. But it is untrue; and that widely. Out of
a given quantity of funds for wages, more or less labour is to be had, according to the quantity
of will with which we can inspire the workman; and the true limit of labour is only in the
limit of this moral stimulus of the will, and of the bodily power. In an ultimate, but entirely
unpractical sense, labour is limited by capital, as it is by matter--that is to say, where
there is no material, there can be no work,--but in the practical sense, labour is limited
only by the great original capital of head, heart, and hand. Even in the most artificial relations
of commerce, labour is to capital as fire to fuel: out of so much fuel, you can have only so
much fire; but out of so much fuel, you shall have so much fire,--not in proportion to the
mass of combustible, but to the force of wind that fans and water that quenches; and the appliance
of both. And labour is furthered, as conflagration is, not so much by added fuel, as by admitted
air.[20]

51. For which reasons, I had to insert, in § 49, the qualifying "probably;" for it can never
be said positively that the purchase-money, or wages fund of any trade is withdrawn from some
other trade. The object itself may be the stimulus of the production of the money which buys
it; that is to say, the work by which the purchaser obtained the means of buying it, would
not have been done by him unless he had wanted that particular thing. And the production of
any article not intrinsically (nor in the process of manufacture) injurious, is useful, if
the desire of it causes productive labour in other directions.

52. In the national store, therefore, the presence of things intrinsically valueless does not
imply an entirely correlative absence of things valuable. We cannot be certain that all the
labour spent on vanity has been diverted from reality, and that for every bad thing produced,
a precious thing has been lost. In great measure, the vain things represent the results of
roused indolence; they have been carved, as toys, in extra time; and, if they had not been
made, nothing else would have been made. Even to munitions of war this principle applies; they
partly represent the work of men who, if they had not made spears, would never have made pruning
hooks, and who are incapable of any activities but those of contest.

53. Thus then, finally, the nature of the store has to be considered under two main lights;
the one, that of its immediate and actual utility; the other, that of the past national character
which it signifies by its production, and future character which it must develop by its use.
And the issue of this investigation will be to show us that.

Economy does not depend merely on principles of "demand and supply," but primarily on what
is demanded, and what is supplied; which I will beg of you to observe, and take to heart.

54. II. QUESTION SECOND.--What is the quantity of the store, in relation to the population?

It follows from what has been already stated that the accurate form in which this question
has to be put is--"What quantity of each article composing the store exists in proportion to
the real need for it by the population?" But we shall for the time assume, in order to keep
all our terms at the simplest, that the store is wholly composed of useful articles, and accurately
proportioned to the several needs for them.

Now it cannot be assumed, because the store is large in proportion to the number of the people,
that the people must be in comfort; nor because it is small, that they must be in distress.
An active and economical race always produces more than it requires, and lives (if it is permitted
to do so) in competence on the produce of its daily labour. The quantity of its store, great
or small, is therefore in many respects indifferent to it, and cannot be inferred from its
aspect. Similarly an inactive and wasteful population, which cannot live by its daily labour,
but is dependent, partly or wholly, on consumption of its store, may be (by various difficulties,
hereafter to be examined, in realizing or getting at such store) retained in a state of abject
distress, though its possessions may be immense. But the results always involved in the magnitude
of store are, the commercial power of the nation, its security, and its mental character. Its
commercial power, in that according to the quantity of its store, may be the extent of its
dealings; its security, in that according to the quantity of its store are its means of sudden
exertion or sustained endurance; and its character, in that certain conditions of civilization
cannot be attained without permanent and continually accumulating store, of great intrinsic
value, and of peculiar nature.[21]

55. Now, seeing that these three advantages arise from largeness of store in proportion to
population, the question arises immediately, "Given the store--is the nation enriched by diminution
of its numbers? Are a successful national speculation, and a pestilence, economically the same
thing?"

This is in part a sophistical question; such as it would be to ask whether a man was richer
when struck by disease which must limit his life within a predicable period, than he was when
in health. He is enabled to enlarge his current expenses, and has for all purposes a larger
sum at his immediate disposal (for, given the fortune, the shorter the life, the larger the
annuity); yet no man considers himself richer because he is condemned by his physician.

56. The logical reply is that, since Wealth is by definition only the means of life, a nation
cannot be enriched by its own mortality. Or in shorter words, the life is more than the meat;
and existence itself, more wealth than the means of existence. Whence, of two nations who have
equal store, the more numerous is to be considered the richer, provided the type of the inhabitant
be as high (for, though the relative bulk of their store be less, its relative efficiency,
or the amount of effectual wealth, must be greater). But if the type of the population be deteriorated
by increase of its numbers, we have evidence of poverty in its worst influence; and then, to
determine whether the nation in its total may still be justifiably esteemed rich, we must set
or weigh, the number of the poor against that of the rich.

To effect which piece of scale-work, it is of course necessary to determine, first, who are
poor and who are rich; nor this only, but also how poor and how rich they are. Which will prove
a curious thermometrical investigation; for we shall have to do for gold and for silver, what
we have done for quicksilver;--determine, namely, their freezing-point, their zero, their temperate
and fever-heat points; finally, their vaporescent point, at which riches, sometimes explosively,
as lately in America, "make to themselves wings:"--and correspondently, the number of degrees
below zero at which poverty, ceasing to brace with any wholesome cold, burns to the bone.[22]

57. For the performance of these operations, in the strictest sense scientific, we will first
look to the existing so-called "science" of Political Economy; we will ask it to define for
us the comparatively and superlatively rich, and the comparatively and superlatively poor;
and on its own terms--if any terms it can pronounce--examine, in our prosperous England, how
many rich and how many poor people there are; and whether the quantity and intensity of the
poverty is indeed so overbalanced by the quantity and intensity of wealth, that we may permit
ourselves a luxurious blindness to it, and call ourselves, complacently, a rich country. And
if we find no clear definition in the existing science, we will endeavour for ourselves to
fix the true degrees of the scale, and to apply them.[23]

       *       *       *       *       *

58. QUESTION THIRD. What is the quantity of the store in relation to the Currency?

We have seen that the real worth of the currency, so far as dependent on its relation to the
magnitude of the store, may vary, within certain limits, without affecting its worth in exchange.
The diminution or increase of the represented wealth may be unperceived, and the currency may
be taken either for more or less than it is truly worth. Usually it is taken for much more;
and its power in exchange, or credit-power, is thus increased up to a given strain upon its
relation to existing wealth. This credit-power is of chief importance in the thoughts, because
most sharply present to the experience, of a mercantile community: but the conditions of its
stability[24] and all other relations of the currency to the material store are entirely simple
in principle, if not in action. Far other than simple are the relations of the currency to
the available labour which it also represents. For this relation is involved not only with
that of the magnitude of the store to the number, but with that of the magnitude of the store
to the mind, of the population. Its proportion to their number, and the resulting worth of
currency, are calculable; but its proportion to their will for labour is not. The worth of
the piece of money which claims a given quantity of the store is, in exchange, less or greater
according to the facility of obtaining the same quantity of the same thing without having recourse
to the store. In other words it depends on the immediate Cost and Price of the thing. We must
now, therefore, complete the definition of these terms.

59. All cost and price are counted in Labour. We must know first, therefore, what is to be
counted as Labour.

I have already defined labour to be the Contest of the life of man with an opposite. Literally,
it is the quantity of "Lapse," loss, or failure of human life, caused by any effort. It is
usually confused with effort itself, or the application of power (opera); but there is much
effort which is merely a mode of recreation, or of pleasure. The most beautiful actions of
the human body, and the highest results of the human intelligence, are conditions, or achievements,
of quite unlaborious,--nay, of recreative,--effort. But labour is the suffering in effort.
It is the negative quantity, or quantity of de-feat, which has to be counted against every
Feat, and of de-fect which has to be counted against every Fact, or Deed of men. In brief,
it is "that quantity of our toil which we die in."

We might, therefore, à priori, conjecture (as we shall ultimately find), that it cannot be
bought, nor sold. Everything else is bought and sold for Labour, but labour itself cannot be
bought nor sold for anything, being priceless.[25] The idea that it is a commodity to be bought
or sold, is the alpha and omega of Politico-Economic fallacy.

60. This being the nature of labour, the "Cost" of anything is the quantity of labour necessary
to obtain it;--the quantity for which, or at which, it "stands" (constant). It is literally
the "Constancy" of the thing;--you shall win it--move it--come at it, for no less than this.

Cost is measured and measurable (using the accurate Latin terms) only in "labour," not in "opera."[26]
It does not matter how much work a thing needs to produce it; it matters only how much distress.
Generally the more the power it requires, the less the distress; so that the noblest works
of man cost less than the meanest.

True labour, or spending of life, is either of the body, in fatigue or pain; of the temper
or heart (as in perseverance of search for things,--patience in waiting for them,--fortitude
or degradation in suffering for them, and the like), or of the intellect. All these kinds of
labour are supposed to be included in the general term, and the quantity of labour is then
expressed by the time it lasts. So that a unit of labour is "an hour's work" or a day's work,
as we may determine.[27]

61. Cost, like value, is both intrinsic and effectual. Intrinsic cost is that of getting the
thing in the right way; effectual cost is that of getting the thing in the way we set about
it. But intrinsic cost cannot be made a subject of analytical investigation, being only partially
discoverable, and that by long experience. Effectual cost is all that the political Economist
can deal with; that is to say, the cost of the thing under existing circumstances, and by known
processes.

Cost, being dependent much on application of method, varies with the quantity of the thing
wanted, and with the number of persons who work for it. It is easy to get a little of some
things, but difficult to get much; it is impossible to get some things with few hands, but
easy to get them with many.

62. The cost and value of things, however difficult to determine accurately, are thus both
dependent on ascertainable physical circumstances.[28]

But their price is dependent on the human will.

Such and such a thing is demonstrably good for so much. And it may demonstrably be had for so much.

But it remains questionable, and in all manner of ways questionable, whether I choose to give
so much.[29]

This choice is always a relative one. It is a choice to give a price for this, rather than
for that;--a resolution to have the thing, if getting it does not involve the loss of a better
thing. Price depends, therefore, not only on the cost of the commodity itself, but on its relation
to the cost of every other attainable thing.

Farther. The power of choice is also a relative one. It depends not merely on our own estimate
of the thing, but on everybody else's estimate; therefore on the number and force of the will
of the concurrent buyers, and on the existing quantity of the thing in proportion to that number
and force.

Hence the price of anything depends on four variables.

(1.) Its cost.

(2.) Its attainable quantity at that cost.

(3.) The number and power of the persons who want it.

(4.) The estimate they have formed of its desirableness.

Its value only affects its price so far as it is contemplated in this estimate; perhaps, therefore,
not at all.

63. Now, in order to show the manner in which price is expressed in terms of a currency, we
must assume these four quantities to be known, and the "estimate of desirableness," commonly
called the Demand, to be certain. We will take the number of persons at the lowest. Let A and
B be two labourers who "demand," that is to say, have resolved to labour for, two articles,
a and b. Their demand for these articles (if the reader likes better, he may say their need)
is to be conceived as absolute, their existence depending on the getting these two things.
Suppose, for instance, that they are bread and fuel, in a cold country, and let a represent
the least quantity of bread, and b the least quantity of fuel, which will support a man's life
for a day. Let a be producible by an hour's labour, but b only by two hours' labour.

Then the cost of a is one hour, and of b two (cost, by our definition, being expressible in
terms of time). If, therefore, each man worked both for his corn and fuel, each would have
to work three hours a day. But they divide the labour for its greater ease.[30] Then if A works
three hours, he produces 3 a, which is one a more than both the men want. And if B works three
hours, he produces only 1-1/2 b, or half of b less than both want. But if A work three hours
and B six, A has 3 a, and B has 3 b, a maintenance in the right proportion for both for a day
and half; so that each might take half a day's rest. But as B has worked double time, the whole
of this day's rest belongs in equity to him. Therefore the just exchange should be, A giving
two a for one b, has one a and one b;--maintenance for a day. B giving one b for two a, has
two a and two b; maintenance for two days.

But B cannot rest on the second day, or A would be left without the article which B produces.
Nor is there any means of making the exchange just, unless a third labourer is called in. Then
one workman, A, produces a, and two, B and C, produce b:--A, working three hours, has three
a;--B, three hours, 1-1/2 b;--C, three hours, 1-1/2 b. B and C each give half of b for a, and
all have their equal daily maintenance for equal daily work.

To carry the example a single step farther, let three articles, a, b, and c be needed.

Let a need one hour's work, b two, and c four; then the day's work must be seven hours, and
one man in a day's work can make 7 a, or 3-1/2 b, or 1-3/4 c.

Therefore one A works for a, producing 7 a; two B's work for b, producing 7 b; four C's work
for c, producing 7 c.

A has six a to spare, and gives two a for one b, and four a for one c. Each B has 2-1/2 b to
spare, and gives 1/2 b for one a, and two b for one c.

Each C has 3/4 of c to spare, and gives 1/2 c for one b, and 1/4 of c for one a.

And all have their day's maintenance.

Generally, therefore, it follows that if the demand is constant,[31] the relative prices of
things are as their costs, or as the quantities of labour involved in production.

64. Then, in order to express their prices in terms of a currency, we have only to put the
currency into the form of orders for a certain quantity of any given article (with us it is
in the form of orders for gold), and all quantities of other articles are priced by the relation
they bear to the article which the currency claims.

But the worth of the currency itself is not in the slightest degree founded more on the worth
of the article which it either claims or consists in (as gold) than on the worth of every other
article for which the gold is exchangeable. It is just as accurate to say, "so many pounds
are worth an acre of land," as "an acre of land is worth so many pounds." The worth of gold,
of land, of houses, and of food, and of all other things, depends at any moment on the existing
quantities and relative demands for all and each; and a change in the worth of, or demand for,
any one, involves an instantaneously correspondent change in the worth of, and demand for,
all the rest;--a change as inevitable and as accurately balanced (though often in its process
as untraceable) as the change in volume of the outflowing river from some vast lake, caused
by change in the volume of the inflowing streams, though no eye can trace, nor instrument detect,
motion, either on its surface, or in the depth.

65. Thus, then, the real working power or worth of the currency is founded on the entire sum
of the relative estimates formed by the population of its possessions; a change in this estimate
in any direction (and therefore every change in the national character), instantly alters the
value of money, in its second great function of commanding labour. But we must always carefully
and sternly distinguish between this worth of currency, dependent on the conceived or appreciated
value of what it represents, and the worth of it, dependent on the existence of what it represents.
A currency is true, or false, in proportion to the security with which it gives claim to the
possession of land, house, horse, or picture; but a currency is strong or weak,[32] worth much,
or worth little, in proportion to the degree of estimate in which the nation holds the house,
horse, or picture which is claimed. Thus the power of the English currency has been, till of
late, largely based on the national estimate of horses and of wine: so that a man might always
give any price to furnish choicely his stable, or his cellar; and receive public approval therefor:
but if he gave the same sum to furnish his library, he was called mad or a biblio-maniac. And
although he might lose his fortune by his horses, and his health or life by his cellar, and
rarely lost either by his books, he was yet never called a Hippo-maniac nor an Oino-maniac;
but only Biblio-maniac, because the current worth of money was understood to be legitimately
founded on cattle and wine, but not on literature. The prices lately given at sales for pictures
and MSS. indicate some tendency to change in the national character in this respect, so that
the worth of the currency may even come in time to rest, in an acknowledged manner, somewhat
on the state and keeping of the Bedford missal, as well as on the health of Caractacus or Blink
Bonny; and old pictures be considered property, no less than old port. They might have been
so before now, but that it is more difficult to choose the one than the other.

66. Now, observe, all these sources of variation in the power of the currency exist, wholly
irrespective of the influences of vice, indolence, and improvidence. We have hitherto supposed,
throughout the analysis, every professing labourer to labour honestly, heartily, and in harmony
with his fellows. We have now to bring farther into the calculation the effects of relative
industry, honour, and forethought; and thus to follow out the bearings of our second inquiry:
Who are the holders of the Store and Currency, and in what proportions?

This, however, we must reserve for our next paper--noticing here only that, however distinct
the several branches of the subject are, radically, they are so interwoven in their issues
that we cannot rightly treat any one, till we have taken cognizance of all. Thus the need of
the currency in proportion to number of population is materially influenced by the probable
number of the holders in proportion to the non-holders; and this again, by the number of holders
of goods, or wealth, in proportion to the non-holders of goods. For as, by definition, the
currency is a claim to goods which are not possessed, its quantity indicates the number of
claimants in proportion to the number of holders; and the force and complexity of claim. For
if the claims be not complex, currency as a means of exchange may be very small in quantity.
A sells some corn to B, receiving a promise from B to pay in cattle, which A then hands over
to C, to get some wine. C in due time claims the cattle from B; and B takes back his promise.
These exchanges have, or might have been, all effected with a single coin or promise; and the
proportion of the currency to the store would in such circumstances indicate only the circulating
vitality of it--that is to say, the quantity and convenient divisibility of that part of the
store which the habits of the nation keep in circulation. If a cattle breeder is content to
live with his household chiefly on meat and milk, and does not want rich furniture, or jewels,
or books--if a wine and corn grower maintains himself and his men chiefly on grapes and bread;--if
the wives and daughters of families weave and spin the clothing of the household, and the nation,
as a whole, remains content with the produce of its own soil and the work of its own hands,
it has little occasion for circulating media. It pledges and promises little and seldom; exchanges
only so far as exchange is necessary for life. The store belongs to the people in whose hands
it is found, and money is little needed either as an expression of right, or practical means
of division and exchange.

67. But in proportion as the habits of the nation become complex and fantastic (and they may
be both, without therefore being civilized), its circulating medium must increase in proportion
to its store. If every one wants a little of everything,--if food must be of many kinds, and
dress of many fashions,--if multitudes live by work which, ministering to fancy, has its pay
measured by fancy, so that large prices will be given by one person for what is valueless to
another,--if there are great inequalities of knowledge, causing great inequalities of estimate,--and,
finally, and worst of all, if the currency itself, from its largeness, and the power which
the possession of it implies, becomes the sole object of desire with large numbers of the nation,
so that the holding of it is disputed among them as the main object of life:--in each and all
of these cases, the currency necessarily enlarges in proportion to the store; and as a means
of exchange and division, as a bond of right, and as an object of passion, has a more and more
important and malignant power over the nation's dealings, character, and life.

Against which power, when, as a bond of Right, it becomes too conspicuous and too burdensome,
the popular voice is apt to be raised in a violent and irrational manner, leading to revolution
instead of remedy. Whereas all possibility of Economy depends on the clear assertion and maintenance
of this bond of right, however burdensome. The first necessity of all economical government
is to secure the unquestioned and unquestionable working of the great law of Property--that
a man who works for a thing shall be allowed to get it, keep it, and consume it, in peace;
and that he who does not eat his cake to-day, shall be seen, without grudging, to have his
cake to-morrow. This, I say, is the first point to be secured by social law; without this,
no political advance, nay, no political existence, is in any sort possible. Whatever evil,
luxury, iniquity, may seem to result from it, this is nevertheless the first of all Equities;
and to the enforcement of this, by law and by police-truncheon, the nation must always primarily
set its mind--that the cupboard door may have a firm lock to it, and no man's dinner be carried
off by the mob, on its way home from the baker's. Which, thus fearlessly asserting, we shall
endeavour in next paper to consider how far it may be practicable for the mob itself, also,
in due breadth of dish, to have dinners to carry home.

FOOTNOTES:

[14] Remember carefully this statement, that Wealth consists only in the things which the nature
of humanity has rendered in all ages, and must render in all ages to come, (that is what I
meant by "constant") the objects of legitimate desire. And see Appendix II.

[15] The Wanderings, observe, not the Right goings, of Imagination. She is very far from despising
these.

[16] See Appendix III.

[17] I would beg the reader's very close attention to these 37th and 38th paragraphs. It would
be well if a dogged conviction could be enforced on nations, as on individuals, that, with
few exceptions, what they cannot at present pay for, they should not at present have.

[18] See Appendix IV.

[19] I little thought, what Trionfo della Morte would be, for this very cause, and in literal
fulfilment of the closing words of the 47th paragraph, over the fields and houses of Europe,
and over its fairest city--within seven years from the day I wrote it.

[20] The meaning of which is, that you may spend a great deal of money, and get very little
work for it, and that little bad; but having good "air" or "spirit," to put life into it, with
very little money, you may get a great deal of work, and all good; which, observe, is an arithmetical,
not at all a poetical or visionary circumstance.

[21] More especially, works of great art.

[22] The meaning of that, in plain English, is, that we must find out how far poverty and riches
are good or bad for people, and what is the difference between being miserably poor--so as,
perhaps, to be driven to crime, or to pass life in suffering--and being blessedly poor, in
the sense meant in the Sermon on the Mount. For I suppose the people who believe that sermon,
do not think (if they ever honestly ask themselves what they do think), either that Luke vi.
24. is a merely poetical exclamation, or that the Beatitude of Poverty has yet been attained
in St. Martin's Lane and other back streets of London.

[23] Large plans!--Eight years are gone, and nothing done yet. But I keep my purpose of making
one day this balance, or want of balance, visible, in those so seldom used scales of Justice.

[24] These are nearly all briefly represented by the image used for the force of money by Dante,
of mast and sail:--

    Quali dal vento le gonfiate vele
    Caggiono avvolte, poi che l'alber fiacca
    Tal cadde a terra la fiera crudele.

The image may be followed out, like all of Dante's, into as close detail as the reader chooses.
Thus the stress of the sail must be proportioned to the strength of the mast, and it is only
in unforeseen danger that a skilful seaman ever carries all the canvas his spars will bear,
states of mercantile languor are like the flap of the sail in a calm; of mercantile precaution,
like taking in reefs; and mercantile ruin is instant on the breaking of the mast.

[I mean by credit-power, the general impression on the national mind that a sovereign, or any
other coin, is worth so much bread and cheese--so much wine--so much horse and carriage--or
so much fine art: it may be really worth, when tried, less or more than is thought: the thought
of it is the credit-power.]

[25] The object of Political Economy is not to buy, nor to sell labour, but to spare it. Every
attempt to buy or sell it is, in the outcome, ineffectual; so far as successful, it is not
sale, but Betrayal; and the purchase-money is a part of that thirty pieces which bought, first
the greatest of labours, and afterwards the burial-field of the Stranger; for this purchase-money,
being in its very smallness or vileness the exactly measured opposite of the "vilis annona
amicorum," makes all men strangers to each other.

[26] Cicero's distinction, "sordidi quæstus, quorum operæ, non quorum artes emuntur," admirable
in principle, is inaccurate in expression, because Cicero did not practically know how much
operative dexterity is necessary in all the higher arts; but the cost of this dexterity is
incalculable. Be it great or small, the "cost" of the mere perfectness of touch in a hammer-stroke
of Donatello's, or a pencil-touch of Correggio's, is inestimable by any ordinary arithmetic.

[Old notes, these, more embarrassing I now perceive, than elucidatory; but right, and worth
retaining.]

[27] Only observe, as some labour is more destructive of life than other labour, the hour or
day of the more destructive toil is supposed to include proportionate rest. Though men do not,
or cannot, usually take such rest, except in death.

[28] There is, therefore, observe, no such thing as cheapness (in the common use of that term),
without some error or injustice. A thing is said to be cheap, not because it is common, but
because it is supposed to be sold under its worth. Everything has its proper and true worth
at any given time, in relation to everything else; and at that worth should be bought and sold.
If sold under it, it is cheap to the buyer by exactly so much as the seller loses, and no more.
Putrid meat, at twopence a pound, is not "cheaper" than wholesome meat at sevenpence a pound;
it is probably much dearer; but if, by watching your opportunity, you can get the wholesome
meat for sixpence a pound, it is cheaper to you by a penny, which you have gained, and the
seller has lost. The present rage for cheapness is either, therefore, simply and literally
a rage for badness of all commodities, or it is an attempt to find persons whose necessities
will force them to let you have more than you should for your money. It is quite easy to produce
such persons, and in large numbers; for the more distress there is in a nation, the more cheapness
of this sort you can obtain, and your boasted cheapness is thus merely a measure of the extent
of your national distress.

There is, indeed, a condition of apparent cheapness, which we have some right to be triumphant
in; namely, the real reduction in cost of articles by right application of labour. But in this
case the article is only cheap with reference to its former price; the so-called cheapness
is only our expression for the sensation of contrast between its former and existing prices.
So soon as the new methods of producing the article are established, it ceases to be esteemed
either cheap or dear, at the new price, as at the old one, and is felt to be cheap only when
accident enables it to be purchased beneath this new value. And it is no advantage to produce
the article more easily, except as it enables you to multiply your population. Cheapness of
this kind is merely the discovery that more men can be maintained on the same ground; and the
question how many you will maintain in proportion to your additional means, remains exactly
in the same terms that it did before.

A form of immediate cheapness results, however, in many cases, without distress, from the labour
of a population where food is redundant, or where the labour by which the food is produced
leaves much idle time on their hands, which may be applied to the production of "cheap" articles.

All such phenomena indicate to the political economist places where the labour is unbalanced.
In the first case, the just balance is to be effected by taking labourers from the spot where
pressure exists, and sending them to that where food is redundant. In the second, the cheapness
is a local accident, advantageous to the local purchaser, disadvantageous to the local producer.
It is one of the first duties of commerce to extend the market, and thus give the local producer
his full advantage.

Cheapness caused by natural accidents of harvest, weather, &c., is always counterbalanced,
in due time, by natural scarcity, similarly caused. It is the part of wise government, and
healthy commerce, so to provide in times and places of plenty for times and places of dearth,
as that there shall never be waste, nor famine.

Cheapness caused by gluts of the market is merely a disease of clumsy and wanton commerce.

[29] Price has been already defined (p. 9) to be the quantity of labour which the possessor
of a thing is willing to take for it. It is best to consider the price to be that fixed by
the possessor, because the possessor has absolute power of refusing sale, while the purchaser
has no absolute power of compelling it; but the effectual or market price is that at which
their estimates coincide.

[30] This "greater ease" ought to be allowed for by a diminution in the times of the divided
work; but as the proportion of times would remain the same, I do not introduce this unnecessary
complexity into the calculation.

[31] Compare Unto this Last, p. 115, et seq.

[32] [That is to say, the love of money is founded first on the intenseness of desire for given
things; a youth will rob the till, now-a-days, for pantomime tickets and cigars; the "strength"
of the currency being irresistible to him, in consequence of his desire for those luxuries.]

CHAPTER III.

COIN-KEEPING.

68. It will be seen by reference to the last chapter that our present task is to examine the
relation of holders of store to holders of currency; and of both to those who hold neither.
In order to do this, we must determine on which side we are to place substances such as gold,
commonly known as bases of currency. By aid of previous definitions the reader will now be
able to understand closer statements than have yet been possible.

69. The currency of any country consists of every document acknowledging debt, which is transferable
in the country.[33]

This transferableness depends upon its intelligibility and credit. Its intelligibility depends
chiefly on the difficulty of forging anything like it;--its credit much on national character,
but ultimately always on the existence of substantial means of meeting its demand.[34]

As the degrees of transferableness are variable, (some documents passing only in certain places,
and others passing, if at all, for less than their inscribed value), both the mass, and, so
to speak, fluidity, of the currency, are variable. True or perfect currency flows freely, like
a pure stream; it becomes sluggish or stagnant in proportion to the quantity of less transferable
matter which mixes with it, adding to its bulk, but diminishing its purity. [Articles of commercial
value, on which bills are drawn, increase the currency indefinitely; and substances of intrinsic
value if stamped or signed without restriction so as to become acknowledgments of debt, increase
it indefinitely also.] Every bit of gold found in Australia, so long as it remains uncoined,
is an article offered for sale like any other; but as soon as it is coined into pounds, it
diminishes the value of every pound we have now in our pockets.

70. Legally authorized or national currency, in its perfect condition, is a form of public
acknowledgment of debt, so regulated and divided that any person presenting a commodity of
tried worth in the public market, shall, if he please, receive in exchange for it a document
giving him claim to the return of its equivalent, (1) in any place, (2) at any time, and (3)
in any kind.

When currency is quite healthy and vital, the persons entrusted with its management are always
able to give on demand either,

A. The assigning document for the assigned quantity of goods. Or,

B. The assigned quantity of goods for the assigning document.

If they cannot give document for goods, the national exchange is at fault.

If they cannot give goods for document, the national credit is at fault.

The nature and power of the document are therefore to be examined under the three relations
it bears to Place, Time, and Kind.

71. (1.) It gives claim to the return of equivalent wealth in any Place. Its use in this function
is to save carriage, so that parting with a bushel of corn in London, we may receive an order
for a bushel of corn at the Antipodes, or elsewhere. To be perfect in this use, the substance
of currency must be to the maximum portable, credible, and intelligible. Its non-acceptance
or discredit results always from some form of ignorance or dishonour: so far as such interruptions
rise out of differences in denomination, there is no ground for their continuance among civilized
nations. It may be convenient in one country to use chiefly copper for coinage, in another
silver, and in another gold,--reckoning accordingly in centimes, francs, or zecchins: but that
a franc should be different in weight and value from a shilling, and a zwanziger vary from
both, is wanton loss of commercial power.

72. (2.) It gives claim to the return of equivalent wealth at any Time. In this second use,
currency is the exponent of accumulation: it renders the laying-up of store at the command
of individuals unlimitedly possible;--whereas, but for its intervention, all gathering would
be confined within certain limits by the bulk of property, or by its decay, or the difficulty
of its guardianship. "I will pull down my barns and build greater," cannot be a daily saying;
and all material investment is enlargement of care. The national currency transfers the guardianship
of the store to many; and preserves to the original producer the right of re-entering on its
possession at any future period.

73. (3.) It gives claim (practical, though not legal) to the return of equivalent wealth in
any Kind. It is a transferable right, not merely to this or that, but to anything; and its
power in this function is proportioned to the range of choice. If you give a child an apple
or a toy, you give him a determinate pleasure, but if you give him a penny, an indeterminate
one, proportioned to the range of selection offered by the shops in the village. The power
of the world's currency is similarly in proportion to the openness of the world's fair, and,
commonly, enhanced by the brilliancy of external aspect, rather than solidity of its wares.

74. We have said that the currency consists of orders for equivalent goods. If equivalent,
their quality must be guaranteed. The kinds of goods chosen for specific claim must, therefore,
be capable of test, while, also, that a store may be kept in hand to meet the call of the currency,
smallness of bulk, with great relative value, is desirable; and indestructibility, over at
least a certain period, essential.

Such indestructibility, and facility of being tested, are united in gold; its intrinsic value
is great, and its imaginary value greater; so that, partly through indolence, partly through
necessity and want of organization, most nations have agreed to take gold for the only basis
of their currencies;--with this grave disadvantage, that its portability enabling the metal
to become an active part of the medium of exchange, the stream of the currency itself becomes
opaque with gold--half currency and half commodity, in unison of functions which partly neutralize,
partly enhance each other's force.

75. They partly neutralize, since in so far as the gold is commodity, it is bad currency, because
liable to sale; and in so far as it is currency, it is bad commodity, because its exchange
value interferes with its practical use. Especially its employment in the higher branches of
the arts becomes unsafe on account of its liability to be melted down for exchange.

Again. They partly enhance, since in so far as the gold has acknowledged intrinsic value, it
is good currency, because everywhere acceptable; and in so far as it has legal exchangeable
value, its worth as a commodity is increased. We want no gold in the form of dust or crystal;
but we seek for it coined, because in that form it will pay baker and butcher. And this worth
in exchange not only absorbs a large quantity in that use,[35] but greatly increases the effect
on the imagination of the quantity used in the arts. Thus, in brief, the force of the functions
is increased, but their precision blunted, by their unison.

76. These inconveniences, however, attach to gold as a basis of currency on account of its
portability and preciousness. But a far greater inconvenience attaches to it as the only legal
basis of currency. Imagine gold to be only attainable in masses weighing several pounds each,
and its value, like that of malachite or marble, proportioned to its largeness of bulk;--it
could not then get itself confused with the currency in daily use, but it might still remain
as its basis; and this second inconvenience would still affect it, namely, that its significance
as an expression of debt varies, as that of every other article would, with the popular estimate
of its desirableness, and with the quantity offered in the market. My power of obtaining other
goods for gold depends always on the strength of public passion for gold, and on the limitation
of its quantity, so that when either of two things happen--that the world esteems gold less,
or finds it more easily--my right of claim is in that degree effaced; and it has been even
gravely maintained that a discovery of a mountain of gold would cancel the National Debt; in
other words, that men may be paid for what costs much in what costs nothing. Now, it is true
that there is little chance of sudden convulsion in this respect; the world will not so rapidly
increase in wisdom as to despise gold on a sudden; and perhaps may [for a little time] desire
it more eagerly the more easily it is obtained; nevertheless, the right of debt ought not to
rest on a basis of imagination; nor should the frame of a national currency vibrate with every
miser's panic, and every merchant's imprudence.

77. There are two methods of avoiding this insecurity, which would have been fallen upon long
ago, if, instead of calculating the conditions of the supply of gold, men had only considered
how the world might live and manage its affairs without gold at all.[36] One is, to base the
currency on substances of truer intrinsic value; the other, to base it on several substances
instead of one. If I can only claim gold, the discovery of a golden mountain starves me; but
if I can claim bread, the discovery of a continent of corn-fields need not trouble me. If,
however, I wish to exchange my bread for other things, a good harvest will for the time limit
my power in this respect; but if I can claim either bread, iron, or silk at pleasure, the standard
of value has three feet instead of one, and will be proportionately firm. Thus, ultimately,
the steadiness of currency depends upon the breadth of its base; but the difficulty of organization
increasing with this breadth, the discovery of the condition at once safest and most convenient[37]
can only be by long analysis, which must for the present be deferred. Gold or silver[38] may
always be retained in limited use, as a luxury of coinage and questionless standard, of one
weight and alloy among all nations, varying only in the die. The purity of coinage, when metallic,
is closely indicative of the honesty of the system of revenue, and even of the general dignity
of the State.[39]

78. Whatever the article or articles may be which the national currency promises to pay, a
premium on that article indicates bankruptcy of the government in that proportion, the division
of its assets being restrained only by the remaining confidence of the holders of notes in
the return of prosperity to the firm. Currencies of forced acceptance, or of unlimited issue,
are merely various modes of disguising taxation, and delaying its pressure, until it is too
late to interfere with the cause of pressure. To do away with the possibility of such disguise
would have been among the first results of a true economical science, had any such existed;
but there have been too many motives for the concealment, so long as it could by any artifices
be maintained, to permit hitherto even the founding of such a science.

79. And indeed, it is only through evil conduct, wilfully persisted in, that there is any embarrassment,
either in the theory or working of currency. No exchequer is ever embarrassed, nor is any financial
question difficult of solution, when people keep their practice honest, and their heads cool.
But when governments lose all office of pilotage, protection, or scrutiny; and live only in
magnificence of authorized larceny, and polished mendacity; or when the people, choosing Speculation
(the s usually redundant in the spelling) instead of Toil, visit no dishonesty with chastisement,
that each may with impunity take his dishonest turn;--there are no tricks of financial terminology
that will save them; all signature and mintage do but magnify the ruin they retard; and even
the riches that remain, stagnant or current, change only from the slime of Avernus to the sand
of Phlegethon--quicksand at the embouchure;--land fluently recommended by recent auctioneers
as "eligible for building leases."

80. Finally, then, the power of true currency is fourfold.

(1.) Credit power. Its worth in exchange, dependent on public opinion of the stability and
honesty of the issuer.

(2.) Real worth. Supposing the gold, or whatever else the currency expressly promises, to be
required from the issuer, for all his notes; and that the call cannot be met in full. Then
the actual worth of the document would be, and its actual worth at any moment is, therefore
to be defined as, what the division of the assets of the issuer would produce for it.

(3.) The exchange power, of its base. Granting that we can get five pounds in gold for our
note, it remains a question how much of other things we can get for five pounds in gold. The
more of other things exist, and the less gold, the greater this power.

(4.) The power over labour, exercised by the given quantity of the base, or of the things to
be got for it. The question in this case is, how much work, and (question of questions!) whose
work, is to be had for the food which five pounds will buy. This depends on the number of the
population, on their gifts, and on their dispositions, with which, down to their slightest
humours, and up to their strongest impulses, the power of the currency varies.

81. Such being the main conditions of national currency, we proceed to examine those of the
total currency, under the broad definition, "transferable acknowledgment of debt;"[40] among
the many forms of which there are in effect only two, distinctly opposed; namely, the acknowledgments
of debts which will be paid, and of debts which will not. Documents, whether in whole or part,
of bad debt, being to those of good debt as bad money to bullion, we put for the present these
forms of imposture aside (as in analysing a metal we should wash it clear of dross), and then
range, in their exact quantities, the true currency of the country on one side, and the store
or property of the country on the other. We place gold, and all such substances, on the side
of documents, as far as they operate by signature;--on the side of store as far as they operate
by value. Then the currency represents the quantity of debt in the country, and the store the
quantity of its possession. The ownership of all the property is divided between the holders
of currency and holders of store, and whatever the claiming value of the currency is at any
moment, that value is to be deducted from the riches of the store-holders.

82. Farther, as true currency represents by definition debts which will be paid, it represents
either the debtor's wealth, or his ability and willingness; that is to say, either wealth existing
in his hands transferred to him by the creditor, or wealth which, as he is at some time surely
to return it, he is either increasing, or, if diminishing, has the will and strength to reproduce.
A sound currency therefore, as by its increase it represents enlarging debt, represents also
enlarging means; but in this curious way, that a certain quantity of it marks the deficiency
of the wealth of the country from what it would have been if that currency had not existed.[41]
In this respect it is like the detritus of a mountain; assume that it lies at a fixed angle,
and the more the detritus, the larger must be the mountain; but it would have been larger still,
had there been none.

83. Farther, though, as above stated, every man possessing money has usually also some property
beyond what is necessary for his immediate wants, and men possessing property usually also
hold currency beyond what is necessary for their immediate exchanges, it mainly determines
the class to which they belong, whether in their eyes the money is an adjunct of the property,
or the property of the money. In the first case the holder's pleasure is in his possessions,
and in his money subordinately, as the means of bettering or adding to them. In the second,
his pleasure is in his money, and in his possessions only as representing it. (In the first
case the money is as an atmosphere surrounding the wealth, rising from it and raining back
upon it; but in the second, it is as a deluge, with the wealth floating, and for the most part
perishing in it.[42]) The shortest distinction between the men is that the one wishes always
to buy, and the other to sell.

84. Such being the great relations of the classes, their several characters are of the highest
importance to the nation; for on the character of the store-holders chiefly depend the preservation,
display, and serviceableness of its wealth; on that of the currency-holders, its distribution;
on that of both, its reproduction.

We shall, therefore, ultimately find it to be of incomparably greater importance to the nation
in whose hands the thing is put, than how much of it is got; and that the character of the
holders may be conjectured by the quality of the store; for such and such a man always asks
for such and such a thing; nor only asks for it, but if it can be bettered, betters it: so
that possession and possessor reciprocally act on each other, through the entire sum of national
possession. The base nation, asking for base things, sinks daily to deeper vileness of nature
and weakness in use; while the noble nation, asking for noble things, rises daily into diviner
eminence in both; the tendency to degradation being surely marked by "[Greek: ataxia];" that
is to say, (expanding the Greek thought), by carelessness as to the hands in which things are
put, consequent dispute for the acquisition of them, disorderliness in the accumulation of
them, inaccuracy in the estimate of them, and bluntness in conception as to the entire nature
of possession.

85. The currency-holders always increase in number and influence in proportion to the bluntness
of nature and clumsiness of the store-holders; for the less use people can make of things,
the more they want of them, and the sooner weary of them, and want to change them for something
else; and all frequency of change increases the quantity and power of currency. The large currency-holder
himself is essentially a person who never has been able to make up his mind as to what he will
have, and proceeds, therefore, in vague collection and aggregation, with more and more infuriate
passion, urged by complacency in progress, vacancy in idea, and pride of conquest.

While, however, there is this obscurity in the nature of possession of currency, there is a
charm in the seclusion of it, which is to some people very enticing. In the enjoyment of real
property, others must partly share. The groom has some enjoyment of the stud, and the gardener
of the garden; but the money is, or seems, shut up; it is wholly enviable. No one else can
have part in any complacencies arising from it.

The power of arithmetical comparison is also a great thing to unimaginative people. They know
always they are so much better than they were, in money; so much better than others, in money;
but wit cannot be so compared, nor character. My neighbour cannot be convinced that I am wiser
than he is, but he can, that I am worth so much more; and the universality of the conviction
is no less flattering than its clearness. Only a few can understand,--none measure--and few
will willingly adore, superiorities in other things; but everybody can understand money, everybody
can count it, and most will worship it.

86. Now, these various temptations to accumulation would be politically harmless if what was
vainly accumulated had any fair chance of being wisely spent. For as accumulation cannot go
on for ever, but must some day end in its reverse--if this reverse were indeed a beneficial
distribution and use, as irrigation from reservoir, the fever of gathering, though perilous
to the gatherer, might be serviceable to the community. But it constantly happens (so constantly,
that it may be stated as a political law having few exceptions), that what is unreasonably
gathered is also unreasonably spent by the persons into whose hands it finally falls. Very
frequently it is spent in war, or else in a stupefying luxury, twice hurtful, both in being
indulged by the rich and witnessed by the poor. So that the mal tener and mal dare are as correlative
as complementary colours; and the circulation of wealth, which ought to be soft, steady, strong,
far-sweeping, and full of warmth, like the Gulf stream, being narrowed into an eddy, and concentrated
at a point, changes into the alternate suction and surrender of Charybdis. Which is indeed,
I doubt not, the true meaning of that marvellous fable, "infinite," as Bacon said of it, "in
matter of meditation."[43]

87. It is a strange habit of wise humanity to speak in enigmas only, so that the highest truths
and usefullest laws must be hunted for through whole picture-galleries of dreams, which to
the vulgar seem dreams only. Thus Homer, the Greek tragedians, Plato, Dante, Chaucer, Shakspeare,
and Goethe, have hidden all that is chiefly serviceable in their work, and in all the various
literature they absorbed and re-embodied, under types which have rendered it quite useless
to the multitude. What is worse, the two primal declarers of moral discovery, Homer and Plato,
are partly at issue; for Plato's logical power quenched his imagination, and he became incapable
of understanding the purely imaginative element either in poetry or painting: he therefore
somewhat overrates the pure discipline of passionate art in song and music, and misses that
of meditative art. There is, however, a deeper reason for his distrust of Homer. His love of
justice, and reverently religious nature, made him dread, as death, every form of fallacy;
but chiefly, fallacy respecting the world to come (his own myths being only symbolic exponents
of a rational hope). We shall perhaps now every day discover more clearly how right Plato was
in this, and feel ourselves more and more wonderstruck that men such as Homer and Dante (and,
in an inferior sphere, Milton), not to speak of the great sculptors and painters of every age,
have permitted themselves, though full of all nobleness and wisdom, to coin idle imaginations
of the mysteries of eternity, and guide the faiths of the families of the earth by the courses
of their own vague and visionary arts: while the indisputable truths of human life and duty,
respecting which they all have but one voice, lie hidden behind these veils of phantasy, unsought,
and often unsuspected. I will gather carefully, out of Dante and Homer, what, in this kind,
bears on our subject, in its due place; the first broad intention of their symbols may be sketched
at once.

88. The rewards of a worthy use of riches, subordinate to other ends, are shown by Dante in
the fifth and sixth orbs of Paradise; for the punishment of their unworthy use, three places
are assigned; one for the avaricious and prodigal whose souls are lost, (Hell, canto 7); one
for the avaricious and prodigal whose souls are capable of purification, (Purgatory, canto
19); and one for the usurers, of whom none can be redeemed (Hell, canto 17). The first group,
the largest in all hell ("gente piu che altrove troppa," compare Virgil's "quæ maxima turba"),
meet in contrary currents, as the waves of Charybdis, casting weights at each other from opposite
sides. This weariness of contention is the chief element of their torture; so marked by the
beautiful lines beginning "Or puoi, figliuol," &c.: (but the usurers, who made their money
inactively, sit on the sand, equally without rest, however. "Di qua, di la, soccorrien," &c.)
For it is not avarice, but contention for riches, leading to this double misuse of them, which,
in Dante's light, is the unredeemable sin. The place of its punishment is guarded by Plutus,
"the great enemy," and "la fièra crudele," a spirit quite different from the Greek Plutus,
who, though old and blind, is not cruel, and is curable, so as to become far-sighted. ([Greek:
ou typhlos all' oxy blepôn].--Plato's epithets in first book of the Laws.) Still more does
this Dantesque type differ from the resplendent Plutus of Goethe in the second part of Faust,
who is the personified power of wealth for good or evil--not the passion for wealth; and again
from the Plutus of Spenser, who is the passion of mere aggregation. Dante's Plutus is specially
and definitely the Spirit of Contention and Competition, or Evil Commerce; because, as I showed
before, this kind of commerce "makes all men strangers;" his speech is therefore unintelligible,
and no single soul of all those ruined by him has recognizable features.

On the other hand, the redeemable sins of avarice and prodigality are, in Dante's sight, those
which are without deliberate or calculated operation. The lust, or lavishness, of riches can
be purged, so long as there has been no servile consistency of dispute and competition for
them. The sin is spoken of as that of degradation by the love of earth; it is purified by deeper
humiliation--the souls crawl on their bellies; their chant is, "my soul cleaveth unto the dust."
But the spirits thus condemned are all recognizable, and even the worst examples of the thirst
for gold, which they are compelled to tell the histories of during the night, are of men swept
by the passion of avarice into violent crime, but not sold to its steady work.

89. The precept given to each of these spirits for its deliverance is--Turn thine eyes to the
lucre (lure) which the Eternal King rolls with the mighty wheels. Otherwise, the wheels of
the "Greater Fortune," of which the constellation is ascending when Dante's dream begins. Compare
George Herbert--

                  "Lift up thy head;
    Take stars for money; stars, not to be told
    By any art, yet to be purchased."

And Plato's notable sentence in the third book of the Polity.--"Tell them they have divine
gold and silver in their souls for ever; that they need no money stamped of men--neither may
they otherwise than impiously mingle the gathering of the divine with the mortal treasure,
for through that which the law of the multitude has coined, endless crimes have been done and
suffered; but in their's is neither pollution nor sorrow."

90. At the entrance of this place of punishment an evil spirit is seen by Dante, quite other
than the "Gran Nemico." The great enemy is obeyed knowingly and willingly; but this spirit--feminine--and
called a Siren--is the "Deceitfulness of riches," [Greek: apatê ploutou] of the Gospels, winning
obedience by guile. This is the Idol of riches, made doubly phantasmal by Dante's seeing her
in a dream. She is lovely to look upon, and enchants by her sweet singing, but her womb is
loathsome. Now, Dante does not call her one of the Sirens carelessly, any more than he speaks
of Charybdis carelessly; and though he had got at the meaning of the Homeric fable only through
Virgil's obscure tradition of it, the clue he has given us is quite enough. Bacon's interpretation,
"the Sirens, or pleasures," which has become universal since his time, is opposed alike to
Plato's meaning and Homer's. The Sirens are not pleasures, but Desires: in the Odyssey they
are the phantoms of vain desire; but in Plato's Vision of Destiny, phantoms of divine desire;
singing each a different note on the circles of the distaff of Necessity, but forming one harmony,
to which the three great Fates put words. Dante, however, adopted the Homeric conception of
them, which was that they were demons of the Imagination, not carnal; (desire of the eyes;
not lust of the flesh); therefore said to be daughters of the Muses. Yet not of the Muses,
heavenly or historical but of the Muse of pleasure; and they are at first winged, because even
vain hope excites and helps when first formed; but afterwards, contending for the possession
of the imagination with the Muses themselves, they are deprived of their wings.

91. And thus we are to distinguish the Siren power from the power of Circe, who is no daughter
of the Muses, but of the strong elements, Sun and Sea; her power is that of frank, and full
vital pleasure, which, if governed and watched, nourishes men; but, unwatched, and having no
"moly," bitterness or delay, mixed with it, turns men into beasts, but does not slay them,--leaves
them, on the contrary, power of revival. She is herself indeed an Enchantress;--pure Animal
life; transforming--or degrading--but always wonderful (she puts the stores on board the ship
invisibly, and is gone again, like a ghost); even the wild beasts rejoice and are softened
around her cave; the transforming poisons she gives to men are mixed with no rich feast, but
with pure and right nourishment,--Pramnian wine, cheese, and flour; that is, wine, milk, and
corn, the three great sustainers of life--it is their own fault if these make swine of them;
(see Appendix V.) and swine are chosen merely as the type of consumption; as Plato's [Greek:
hyôn polis], in the second book of the Polity, and perhaps chosen by Homer with a deeper knowledge
of the likeness in variety of nourishment, and internal form of body.

"Et quel est, s'il vous plait, cet audacieux animal qui se permet d'être bâti au dedans comme
une jolie petite fille?"

"Hélas! chère enfant, j'ai honte de le nommer, et il ne faudra pas m'en vouloir. C'est ...
c'est le cochon. Ce n'est pas précisément flatteur pour vous; mais nous en sommes tous là,
et si cela vous contrarie par trop, il faut aller vous plaindre au bon Dieu qui a voulu que
les choses fussent arrangées ainsi: seulement le cochon, qui ne pense qu'à manger, a l'estomac
bien plus vaste que nous et c'est toujours une consolation."--(Histoire d'une Bouchée de Pain,
Lettre ix.)

92. But the deadly Sirens are in all things opposed to the Circean power. They promise pleasure,
but never give it. They nourish in no wise; but slay by slow death. And whereas they corrupt
the heart and the head, instead of merely betraying the senses, there is no recovery from their
power; they do not tear nor scratch, like Scylla, but the men who have listened to them are
poisoned, and waste away. Note that the Sirens' field is covered, not merely with the bones,
but with the skins, of those who have been consumed there. They address themselves, in the
part of the song which Homer gives, not to the passions of Ulysses, but to his vanity, and
the only man who ever came within hearing of them, and escaped untempted, was Orpheus, who
silenced the vain imaginations by singing the praises of the gods.

93. It is, then, one of these Sirens whom Dante takes as the phantasm or deceitfulness of riches;
but note further, that she says it was her song that deceived Ulysses. Look back to Dante's
account of Ulysses' death, and we find it was not the love of money, but pride of knowledge,
that betrayed him; whence we get the clue to Dante's complete meaning: that the souls whose
love of wealth is pardonable have been first deceived into pursuit of it by a dream of its
higher uses, or by ambition. His Siren is therefore the Philotimé of Spenser, daughter of Mammon--

    "Whom all that folk with such contention
    Do flock about, my deare, my daughter is--
    Honour and dignitie from her alone
    Derived are."

By comparing Spenser's entire account of this Philotimé with Dante's of the Wealth-Siren, we
shall get at the full meaning of both poets; but that of Homer lies hidden much more deeply.
For his Sirens are indefinite; and they are desires of any evil thing; power of wealth is not
specially indicated by him, until, escaping the 'harmonious danger of imagination, Ulysses
has to choose between two practical ways of life, indicated by the two rocks of Scylla and
Charybdis. The monsters that haunt them are quite distinct from the rocks themselves, which,
having many other subordinate significations, are in the main Labour and Idleness, or getting
and spending; each with its attendant monster, or betraying demon. The rock of gaining has
its summit in the clouds, invisible, and not to be climbed; that of spending is low, but marked
by the cursed fig-tree, which has leaves, but no fruit. We know the type elsewhere; and there
is a curious lateral allusion to it by Dante when Jacopo di Sant' Andrea, who had ruined himself
by profusion and committed suicide, scatters the leaves of the bush of Lotto degli Agli, endeavouring
to hide himself among them. We shall hereafter examine the type completely; here I will only
give an approximate rendering of Homer's words, which have been obscured more by translation
than even by tradition.

94. "They are overhanging rocks. The great waves of blue water break round them; and the blessed
Gods call them the Wanderers.

"By one of them no winged thing can pass--not even the wild doves that bring ambrosia to their
father Jove--but the smooth rock seizes its sacrifice of them." (Not even ambrosia to be had
without Labour. The word is peculiar--as a part of anything is offered for Sacrifice; especially
used of heave-offering.) "It reaches the wide heaven with its top, and a dark blue cloud rests
on it, and never passes; neither does the clear sky hold it, in summer nor in harvest. Nor
can any man climb it--not if he had twenty feet and hands, for it is smooth as though it were hewn.

"And in the midst of it is a cave which is turned the way of hell. And therein dwells Scylla,
whining for prey: her cry, indeed, is no louder than that of a newly-born whelp: but she herself
is an awful thing--nor can any creature see her face and be glad; no, though it were a god
that rose against her. For she has twelve feet, all fore-feet, and six necks, and terrible
heads on them; and each has three rows of teeth, full of black death.

"But the opposite rock is lower than this, though but a bow-shot distant; and upon it there
is a great fig-tree, full of leaves; and under it the terrible Charybdis sucks down the black
water. Thrice in the day she sucks it down, and thrice; casts it up again: be not thou there
when she sucks down, for Neptune himself could not save thee."

[Thus far went my rambling note, in Fraser's Magazine. The Editor sent me a compliment on it--of
which I was very proud; what the Publisher thought of it, I am not informed; only I know that
eventually he stopped the papers. I think a great deal of it myself, now, and have put it all
in large print accordingly, and should like to write more; but will, on the contrary, self-denyingly,
and in gratitude to any reader who has got through so much, end my chapter.]

FOOTNOTES:

[33] Remember this definition: it is of great importance as opposed to the imperfect ones usually
given. When first these essays were published, I remember one of their reviewers asking contemptuously,
"Is half-a-crown a document?" it never having before occurred to him that a document might
be stamped as well as written, and stamped on silver as well as on parchment.

[34] I do not mean the demand of the holder of a five-pound note for five pounds, but the demand
of the holder of a pound for a pound's worth of something good.

[35] [Read and think over, the following note very carefully.] The waste of labour in obtaining
the gold, though it cannot be estimated by help of any existing data, may be understood in
its bearing on entire economy by supposing it limited to transactions between two persons.
If two farmers in Australia have been exchanging corn and cattle with each other for years,
keeping their accounts of reciprocal debt in any simple way, the sum of the possessions of
either would not be diminished, though the part of it which was lent or borrowed were only
reckoned by marks on a stone, or notches on a tree; and the one counted himself accordingly,
so many scratches, or so many notches, better than the other. But it would soon be seriously
diminished if, discovering gold in their fields, each resolved only to accept golden counters
for a reckoning; and accordingly, whenever he wanted a sack of corn or a cow, was obliged to
go and wash sand for a week before he could get the means of giving a receipt for them.

[36] It is difficult to estimate the curious futility of discussions such as that which lately
occupied a section of the British Association, on the absorption of gold, while no one can
produce even the simplest of the data necessary for the inquiry. To take the first occurring
one,--What means have we of ascertaining the weight of gold employed this year in the toilettes
of the women of Europe (not to speak of Asia); and, supposing it known, what means of conjecturing
the weight by which, next year, their fancies, and the changes of style among their jewellers,
will diminish or increase it?

[37] See, in Pope's epistle to Lord Bathurst, his sketch of the difficulties and uses of a
currency literally "pecuniary"--(consisting of herds of cattle).

    "His Grace will game--to White's a bull be led," &c.

[38] Perhaps both; perhaps silver only. It may be found expedient ultimately to leave gold
free for use in the arts. As a means of reckoning, the standard might be, and in some cases
has already been, entirely ideal.--See Mill's Political Economy, book iii. chap. VII. at beginning.

[39] The purity of the drachma and zecchin were not without significance of the state of intellect,
art, and policy, both in Athens and Venice;--a fact first impressed upon me ten years ago,
when, in taking daguerreotypes at Venice, I found no purchaseable gold pure enough to gild
them with, except that of the old Venetian zecchin.

[40] Under which term, observe, we include all documents of debt, which, being honest, might
be transferable, though they practically are not transferred; while we exclude all documents
which are in reality worthless, though in fact transferred temporarily, as bad money is. The
document of honest debt, not transferred, is merely to paper currency as gold withdrawn from
circulation is to that of bullion. Much confusion has crept into the reasoning on this subject
from the idea that the withdrawal from circulation is a definable state, whereas it is a graduated
state, and indefinable. The sovereign in my pocket is withdrawn from circulation as long as
I choose to keep it there. It is no otherwise withdrawn if I bury it, nor even if I choose
to make it, and others, into a golden cup, and drink out of them; since a rise in the price
of the wine, or of other things, may at any time cause me to melt the cup and throw it back
into currency; and the bullion operates on the prices of the things in the market as directly,
though not as forcibly, while it is in the form of a cup as it does in the form of a sovereign.
No calculation can be founded on my humour in either case. If I like to handle rouleaus, and
therefore keep a quantity of gold, to play with, in the form of jointed basaltic columns, it
is all one in its effect on the market as if I kept it in the form of twisted filigree, or,
steadily "amicus lamnæ," beat the narrow gold pieces into broad ones, and dined off them. The
probability is greater that I break the rouleau than that I melt the plate; but the increased
probability is not calculable. Thus, documents are only withdrawn from the currency when cancelled,
and bullion when it is so effectually lost as that the probability of finding it is no greater
than of finding new gold in the mine.

[41] For example, suppose an active peasant, having got his ground into good order and built
himself a comfortable house, finding time still on his hands, sees one of his neighbours little
able to work, and ill-lodged, and offers to build him also a house, and to put his land in
order, on condition of receiving for a given period rent for the building and tithe of the
fruits. The offer is accepted, and a document given promissory of rent and tithe. This note
is money. It can only be good money if the man who has incurred the debt so far recovers his
strength as to be able to take advantage of the help he has received, and meet the demand of
the note; if he lets his house fall to ruin, and his field to waste, his promissory note will
soon be valueless: but the existence of the note at all is a consequence of his not having
worked so stoutly as the other. Let him gain as much as to be able to pay back the entire debt;
the note is cancelled, and we have two rich store-holders and no currency.

[42] [You need not trouble yourself to make out the sentence in parenthesis, unless you like,
but do not think it is mere metaphor. It states a fact which I could not have stated so shortly,
but by metaphor.]

[43] [What follows, to the end of the chapter, was a note only, in the first printing; but
for after service, it is of more value than any other part of the book, so I have put it into
the main text.]

CHAPTER IV.

COMMERCE.

95. As the currency conveys right of choice out of many things in exchange for one, so Commerce
is the agency by which the power of choice is obtained; so that countries producing only timber
can obtain for their timber silk and gold; or, naturally producing only jewels and frankincense,
can obtain for them cattle and corn. In this function, commerce is of more importance to a
country in proportion to the limitations of its products, and the restlessness of its fancy;--generally
of greater importance towards Northern latitudes.

96. Commerce is necessary, however, not only to exchange local products, but local skill. Labour
requiring the agency of fire can only be given abundantly in cold countries; labour requiring
suppleness of body and sensitiveness of touch, only in warm ones; labour involving accurate
vivacity of thought only in temperate ones; while peculiar imaginative actions are produced
by extremes of heat and cold, and of light and darkness. The production of great art is limited
to climates warm enough to admit of repose in the open air, and cool enough to render such
repose delightful. Minor variations in modes of skill distinguish every locality. The labour
which at any place is easiest, is in that place cheapest; and it becomes often desirable that
products raised in one country should be wrought in another. Hence have arisen discussions
on "International values" which will be one day remembered as highly curious exercises of the
human mind. For it will be discovered, in due course of tide and time, that international value
is regulated just as inter-provincial or inter-parishional value is. Coals and hops are exchanged
between Northumberland and Kent on absolutely the same principles as iron and wine between
Lancashire and Spain. The greater breadth of an arm of the sea increases the cost, but does
not modify the principle of exchange; and a bargain written in two languages will have no other
economical results than a bargain written in one. The distances of nations are measured, not
by seas, but by ignorances; and their divisions determined, not by dialects, but by enmities.[44]

97. Of course, a system of international values may always be constructed if we assume a relation
of moral law to physical geography; as, for instance, that it is right to cheat or rob across
a river, though not across a road; or across a sea, though not across a river, &c.;--again,
a system of such values may be constructed by assuming similar relations of taxation to physical
geography; as, for instance, that an article should be taxed in crossing a river, but not in
crossing a road; or in being carried fifty miles, but not in being carried five, &c.; such
positions are indeed not easily maintained when once put in logical form; but one law of international
value is maintainable in any form: namely, that the farther your neighbour lives from you,
and the less he understands you, the more you are bound to be true in your dealings with him;
because your power over him is greater in proportion to his ignorance, and his remedy more
difficult in proportion to his distance.[45]

98. I have just said the breadth of sea increases the cost of exchange. Now note that exchange,
or commerce, in itself, is always costly; the sum of the value of the goods being diminished
by the cost of their conveyance, and by the maintenance of the persons employed in it; so that
it is only when there is advantage to both producers (in getting the one thing for the other)
greater than the loss in conveyance, that the exchange is expedient. And it can only be justly
conducted when the porters kept by the producers (commonly called merchants) expect mere pay,
and not profit.[46] For in just commerce there are but three parties--the two persons or societies
exchanging, and the agent or agents of exchange; the value of the things to be exchanged is
known by both the exchangers, and each receives equal value, neither gaining nor losing (for
whatever one gains the other loses). The intermediate agent is paid a known per-centage by
both, partly for labour in conveyance, partly for care, knowledge, and risk; every attempt
at concealment of the amount of the pay indicates either effort on the part of the agent to
obtain unjust profit, or effort on the part of the exchangers to refuse him just pay. But for
the most part it is the first, namely, the effort on the part of the merchant to obtain larger
profit (so-called) by buying cheap and selling dear. Some part, indeed, of this larger gain
is deserved, and might be openly demanded, because it is the reward of the merchant's knowledge,
and foresight of probable necessity; but the greater part of such gain is unjust; and unjust
in this most fatal way, that it depends, first, on keeping the exchangers ignorant of the exchange
value of the articles; and, secondly, on taking advantage of the buyer's need and the seller's
poverty. It is, therefore, one of the essential, and quite the most fatal, forms of usury;
for usury means merely taking an exorbitant[47] sum for the use of anything; and it is no matter
whether the exorbitance is on loan or exchange, on rent or on price--the essence of the usury
being that it is obtained by advantage of opportunity or necessity, and not as due reward for
labour. All the great thinkers, therefore, have held it to be unnatural and impious, in so
far as it feeds on the distress of others, or their folly.[48] Nevertheless, attempts to repress
it by law must for ever be ineffective; though Plato, Bacon, and the First Napoleon--all three
of them men who knew somewhat more of humanity than the "British merchant" usually does--tried
their hands at it, and have left some (probably) good moderative forms of law, which we will
examine in their place. But the only final check upon it must be radical purifying of the national
character, for being, as Bacon calls it, "concessum propter duritiem cordis," it is to be done
away with by touching the heart only; not, however, without medicinal law--as in the case of
the other permission, "propter duritiem." But in this more than in anything (though much in
all, and though in this he would not himself allow of their application, for his own laws against
usury are sharp enough), Plato's words in the fourth book of the Polity are true, that neither
drugs, nor charms, nor burnings, will touch a deep-lying political sore, any more than a deep
bodily one; but only right and utter change of constitution: and that "they do but lose their
labour who think that by any tricks of law they can get the better of these mischiefs of commerce,
and see not that they hew at a Hydra."

99. And indeed this Hydra seems so unslayable, and sin sticks so fast between the joinings
of the stones of buying and selling, that "to trade" in things, or literally "cross-give" them,
has warped itself, by the instinct of nations, into their worst word for fraud; for, because
in trade there cannot but be trust, and it seems also that there cannot but also be injury
in answer to it, what is merely fraud between enemies becomes treachery among friends: and
"trader," "traditor," and "traitor" are but the same word. For which simplicity of language
there is more reason than at first appears: for as in true commerce there is no "profit," so
in true commerce there is no "sale." The idea of sale is that of an interchange between enemies
respectively endeavouring to get the better one of another; but commerce is an exchange between
friends; and there is no desire but that it should be just, any more than there would be between
members of the same family.[49] The moment there is a bargain over the pottage, the family
relation is dissolved:--typically, "the days of mourning for my father are at hand." Whereupon
follows the resolve, "then will I slay my brother."

100. This inhumanity of mercenary commerce is the more notable because it is a fulfilment of
the law that the corruption of the best is the worst. For as, taking the body natural for symbol
of the body politic, the governing and forming powers may be likened to the brain, and the
labouring to the limbs, the mercantile, presiding over circulation and communication of things
in changed utilities, is symbolized by the heart; and, if that hardens, all is lost. And this
is the ultimate lesson which the leader of English intellect meant for us, (a lesson, indeed,
not all his own, but part of the old wisdom of humanity), in the tale of the Merchant of Venice;
in which the true and incorrupt merchant,--kind and free beyond every other Shakspearian conception
of men,--is opposed to the corrupted merchant, or usurer; the lesson being deepened by the
expression of the strange hatred which the corrupted merchant bears to the pure one, mixed
with intense scorn,--

"This is the fool that lent out money gratis; look to him, jailer," (as to lunatic no less
than criminal) the enmity, observe, having its symbolism literally carried out by being aimed
straight at the heart, and finally foiled by a literal appeal to the great moral law that flesh
and blood cannot be weighed, enforced by "Portia"[50] ("Portion"), the type of divine Fortune,
found, not in gold, nor in silver, but in lead, that is to say, in endurance and patience,
not in splendour; and finally taught by her lips also, declaring, instead of the law and quality
of "merces," the greater law and quality of mercy, which is not strained, but drops as the
rain, blessing him that gives and him that takes. And observe that this "mercy" is not the
mean "Misericordia," but the mighty "Gratia," answered by Gratitude, (observe Shylock's leaning
on the, to him detestable, word, gratis, and compare the relations of Grace to Equity given
in the second chapter of the second book of the Memorabilia;) that is to say, it is the gracious
or loving, instead of the strained, or competing manner, of doing things, answered, not only
with "merces" or pay, but with "merci" or thanks. And this is indeed the meaning of the great
benediction "Grace, mercy, and peace," for there can be no peace without grace, (not even by
help of rifled cannon), nor even without triplicity of graciousness, for the Greeks, who began
but with one Grace, had to open their scheme into three before they had done.

101. With the usual tendency of long repeated thought, to take the surface for the deep, we
have conceived these goddesses as if they only gave loveliness to gesture; whereas their true
function is to give graciousness to deed, the other loveliness arising naturally out of that.
In which function Charis becomes Charitas;[51] and has a name and praise even greater than
that of Faith or Truth, for these may be maintained sullenly and proudly; but Charis is in
her countenance always gladdening (Aglaia), and in her service instant and humble; and the
true wife of Vulcan, or Labour. And it is not until her sincerity of function is lost, and
her mere beauty contemplated instead of her patience, that she is born again of the foam flake,
and becomes Aphrodite; and it is then only that she becomes capable of joining herself to war
and to the enmities of men, instead of to labour and their services. Therefore the fable of
Mars and Venus is chosen by Homer, picturing himself as Demodocus, to sing at the games in
the court of Alcinous. Phæacia is the Homeric island of Atlantis; an image of noble and wise
government, concealed, (how slightly!) merely by the change of a short vowel for a long one
in the name of its queen; yet misunderstood by all later writers, (even by Horace, in his "pinguis,
Phæaxque"). That fable expresses the perpetual error of men in thinking that grace and dignity
can only be reached by the soldier, and never by the artisan; so that commerce and the useful
arts have had the honour and beauty taken away, and only the Fraud and Pain left to them, with
the lucre. Which is, indeed, one great reason of the continual blundering about the offices
of government with respect to commerce. The higher classes are ashamed to employ themselves
in it; and though ready enough to fight for (or occasionally against) the people,--to preach
to them,--or judge them, will not break bread for them; the refined upper servant who has willingly
looked after the burnishing of the armoury and ordering of the library, not liking to set foot
in the larder.

102. Farther still. As Charis becomes Charitas on the one side, she becomes--better still--Chara,
Joy, on the other; or rather this is her very mother's milk and the beauty of her childhood;
for God brings no enduring Love, nor any other good, out of pain; nor out of contention; but
out of joy and harmony. And in this sense, human and divine, music and gladness, and the measures
of both, come into her name; and Cher becomes full-vowelled Cheer, and Cheerful; and Chara
opens into Choir and Choral.[52]

103. And lastly. As Grace passes into Freedom of action, Charis becomes Eleutheria, or Liberality;
a form of liberty quite curiously and intensely different from the thing usually understood
by "Liberty" in modern language: indeed, much more like what some people would call slavery:
for a Greek always understood, primarily, by liberty, deliverance from the law of his own passions
(or from what the Christian writers call bondage of corruption), and this a complete liberty:
not being merely safe from the Siren, but also unbound from the mast, and not having to resist
the passion, but making it fawn upon, and follow him--(this may be again partly the meaning
of the fawning beasts about the Circean cave; so, again, George Herbert--

    Correct thy passion's spite,
    Then may the beasts draw thee to happy light)--

And it is only in such generosity that any man becomes capable of so governing others as to
take true part in any system of national economy. Nor is there any other eternal distinction
between the upper and lower classes than this form of liberty, Eleutheria, or benignity, in
the one, and its opposite of slavery, Douleia, or malignity, in the other; the separation of
these two orders of men, and the firm government of the lower by the higher, being the first
conditions of possible wealth and economy in any state,--the Gods giving it no greater gift
than the power to discern its true freemen, and "malignum spernere vulgus."

104. While I have traced the finer and higher laws of this matter for those whom they concern,
I have also to note the material law--vulgarly expressed in the proverb, "Honesty is the best
policy." That proverb is indeed wholly inapplicable to matters of private interest. It is not
true that honesty, as far as material gain is concerned, profits individuals. A clever and
cruel knave will in a mixed society always be richer than an honest person can be. But Honesty
is the best "policy," if policy mean practice of State. For fraud gains nothing in a State.
It only enables the knaves in it to live at the expense of honest people; while there is for
every act of fraud, however small, a loss of wealth to the community. Whatever the fraudulent
person gains, some other person loses, as fraud produces nothing; and there is, besides, the
loss of the time and thought spent in accomplishing the fraud, and of the strength otherwise
obtainable by mutual help (not to speak of the fevers of anxiety and jealousy in the blood,
which are a heavy physical loss, as I will show in due time). Practically, when the nation
is deeply corrupt cheat answers to cheat; every one is in turn imposed upon, and there is to
the body politic the dead loss of the ingenuity, together with the incalculable mischief of
the injury to each defrauded person, producing collateral effect unexpectedly. My neighbour
sells me bad meat: I sell him in return flawed iron. We neither of us get one atom of pecuniary
advantage on the whole transaction, but we both suffer unexpected inconvenience; my men get
scurvy, and his cattle-truck runs off the rails.

105. The examination of this form of Charis must, therefore, lead us into the discussion of
the principles of government in general, and especially of that of the poor by the rich, discovering
how the Graciousness joined with the Greatness, or Love with Majestas, is the true Dei Gratia,
or Divine Right, of every form and manner of King; i. e., specifically, of the thrones, dominations,
princedoms, virtues, and powers of the earth:--of the thrones, stable, or "ruling," literally
right-doing powers ("rex eris, recte si facies"):--of the dominations--lordly, edifying, dominant
and harmonious powers; chiefly domestic, over the "built thing," domus, or house; and inherently
twofold, Dominus and Domina; Lord and Lady:--of the Princedoms, pre-eminent, incipient, creative,
and demonstrative powers; thus poetic and mercantile, in the "princeps carmen deduxisse" and
the merchant-prince:--of the Virtues or Courages; militant, guiding, or Ducal powers:--and
finally of the Strengths, or Forces pure; magistral powers, of the More over the less, and
the forceful and free over the weak and servile elements of life.

Subject enough for the next paper, involving "economical" principles of some importance, of
which, for theme, here is a sentence, which I do not care to translate, for it would sound
harsh in English,[53] though, truly, it is one of the tenderest ever uttered by man; which
may be meditated over, or rather through, in the meanwhile, by any one who will take the pains:--

[Greek: Ar oun, hôsper Hippos tô anepistêmoni men encheirounti de chrêsthai zêmia estin, houtô
kai adelphos, otan tis autô mê epistamenos encheir chrêsthai, zêmia esti];

FOOTNOTES:

[44] I have repeated the substance of this and the next paragraph so often since, that I am
ashamed and weary. The thing is too true, and too simple, it seems, for anybody ever to believe.
Meantime, the theories of "international values," as explained by Modern Political Economy,
have brought about last year's pillage of France by Germany, and the affectionate relations
now existing in consequence between the inhabitants of the right and left banks of the Rhine.

[45] I wish some one would examine and publish accurately the late dealings of the Governors
of the Cape with the Caffirs.

[46] By "pay," I mean wages for labour or skill; by "profit," gain dependent on the state of
the market.

[47] Since I wrote this, I have worked out the question of interest of money, which always,
until lately, had embarrassed and defeated me; and I find that the payment of interest of any
amount whatever is real "usury," and entirely unjustifiable. I was shown this chiefly by the
pamphlets issued by Mr. W. C. Sillar, though I greatly regret the impatience which causes Mr.
Sillar to regard usury as the radical crime in political economy. There are others worse, that
act with it.

[48] Hence Dante's companionship of Cahors, Inf., canto xi., supported by the view taken of
the matter throughout the middle ages, in common with the Greeks.

[49] I do not wonder when I re-read this, that people talk about my "sentiment." But there
is no sentiment whatever in the matter. It is a hard and bare commercial fact, that if two
people deal together who don't try to cheat each other, they will in a given time, make more
money out of each other than if they do. See § 104.

[50] Shakspeare would certainly never have chosen this name had he been forced to retain the
Roman spelling. Like Perdita, "lost lady," or Cordelia, "heart-lady," Portia is "fortune" lady.
The two great relative groups of words, Fortuna, fero, and fors--Portio, porto, and pars (with
the lateral branch, op-portune, im-portune, opportunity, &c.), are of deep and intricate significance;
their various senses of bringing, abstracting, and sustaining being all centralized by the
wheel (which bears and moves at once), or still better, the ball (spera) of Fortune,--"Volve
sua spera, e beata si gode:" the motive power of this wheel distinguishing its goddess from
the fixed majesty of Necessitas with her iron nails; or [Greek: anankê], with her pillar of
fire and iridescent orbits, fixed at the centre. Portus and porta, and gate in its connexion
with gain, form another interesting branch group; and Mors, the concentration of delaying,
is always to be remembered with Fors, the concentration of bringing and bearing, passing on
into Fortis and Fortitude.

[This note is literally a mere memorandum for the future work which I am now completing in
Fors Clavigera; it was printed partly in vanity, but also with real desire to get people to
share the interest I found in the careful study of the leading words in noble languages. Compare
the next note.]

[51] As Charis becomes Charitas, the word "Cher," or "Dear," passes from Shylock's sense of
it (to buy cheap and sell dear) into Antonio's sense of it: emphasized with the final i in
tender "Cheri," and hushed to English calmness in our noble "Cherish." The reader must not
think that any care can be misspent in tracing the connexion and power of the words which we
have to use in the sequel. (See Appendix VI.) Much education sums itself in making men economize
their words, and understand them. Nor is it possible to estimate the harm which has been done,
in matters of higher speculation and conduct, by loose verbiage, though we may guess at it
by observing the dislike which people show to having anything about their religion said to
them in simple words, because then they understand it. Thus congregations meet weekly to invoke
the influence of a Spirit of Life and Truth; yet if any part of that character were intelligibly
expressed to them by the formulas of the service, they would be offended. Suppose, for instance,
in the closing benediction, the clergyman were to give vital significance to the vague word
"Holy," and were to say, "the fellowship of the Helpful and Honest Ghost be with you, and remain
with you always," what would be the horror of many, first at the irreverence of so intelligible
an expression; and secondly, at the discomfortable occurrence of the suspicion that while throughout
the commercial dealings of the week they had denied the propriety of Help, and possibility
of Honesty, the Person whose company they had been now asking to be blessed with could have
no fellowship with cruel people or knaves.

[52] "[Greek: ta men oun alla zôa ouk echein aisthêsin tôn en tais kinêsesi taxeôn oude ataxiôn
ois dê rythmos unoma kai haomonia êmin de ous eipomen tous Theous] (Apollo, the Muses, and
Bacchus--the grave Bacchus, that is--ruling the choir of age; or Bacchus restraining; 'sæva

in motion; but for us, Apollo and Bacchus and the Muses are appointed to mingle in our dances;
and there are they who have given us the sense of delight in rhythm and harmony. And the name
of choir, choral dance, (we may believe,) came from chara (delight)."--Laws, book ii.

[53] [My way now, is to say things plainly, if I can, whether they sound harsh or not;--this
is the translation--"Is it possible, then, that as a horse is only a mischief to any one who
attempts to use him without knowing how, so also our brother, if we attempt to use him without
knowing how, may be a mischief to us?"]

CHAPTER V.

GOVERNMENT.

106. It remains for us, as I stated in the close of the last chapter, to examine first the
principles of government in general, and then those of the government of the Poor by the Rich.

The government of a state consists in its customs, laws, and councils, and their enforcements.

I. CUSTOMS.

As one person primarily differs from another by fineness of nature, and, secondarily, by fineness
of training, so also, a polite nation differs from a savage one, first, by the refinement of
its nature, and secondly by the delicacy of its customs.

In the completeness of custom, which is the nation's self-government, there are three stages--first,
fineness in method of doing or of being;--called the manner or moral of acts; secondly, firmness
in holding such method after adoption, so that it shall become a habit in the character: i.
e., a constant "having" or "behaving;" and, lastly, ethical power in performance and endurance,
which is the skill following on habit, and the ease reached by frequency of right doing.

The sensibility of the nation is indicated by the fineness of its customs; its courage, continence,
and self-respect by its persistence in them.

By sensibility I mean its natural perception of beauty, fitness, and rightness; or of what
is lovely, decent, and just: faculties dependent much on race, and the primal signs of fine
breeding in man; but cultivable also by education, and necessarily perishing without it. True
education has, indeed, no other function than the development of these faculties, and of the
relative will. It has been the great error of modern intelligence to mistake science for education.
You do not educate a man by telling him what he knew not, but by making him what he was not.

And making him what he will remain for ever: for no wash of weeds will bring back the faded
purple. And in that dyeing there are two processes--first, the cleansing and wringing-out,
which is the baptism with water; and then the infusing of the blue and scarlet colours, gentleness
and justice, which is the baptism with fire.

107.[54] The customs and manners of a sensitive and highly-trained race are always Vital: that
is to say, they are orderly manifestations of intense life, like the habitual action of the
fingers of a musician. The customs and manners of a vile and rude race, on the contrary, are
conditions of decay: they are not, properly speaking, habits, but incrustations; not restraints,
or forms, of life; but gangrenes, noisome, and the beginnings of death.

And generally, so far as custom attaches itself to indolence instead of action, and to prejudice
instead of perception, it takes this deadly character, so that thus

    Custom hangs upon us with a weight
    Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life.

But that weight, if it become impetus, (living instead of dead weight) is just what gives value
to custom, when it works with life, instead of against it.

108. The high ethical training of a nation implies perfect Grace, Pitifulness, and Peace; it
is irreconcilably inconsistent with filthy or mechanical employments,--with the desire of money,--and
with mental states of anxiety, jealousy, or indifference to pain. The present insensibility
of the upper classes of Europe to the surrounding aspects of suffering, uncleanness, and crime,
binds them not only into one responsibility with the sin, but into one dishonour with the foulness,
which rot at their thresholds. The crimes daily recorded in the police-courts of London and
Paris (and much more those which are unrecorded) are a disgrace to the whole body politic;[55]
they are, as in the body natural, stains of disease on a face of delicate skin, making the
delicacy itself frightful. Similarly, the filth and poverty permitted or ignored in the midst
of us are as dishonourable to the whole social body, as in the body natural it is to wash the
face, but leave the hands and feet foul. Christ's way is the only true one: begin at the feet;
the face will take care of itself.

109. Yet, since necessarily, in the frame of a nation, nothing but the head can be of gold,
and the feet, for the work they have to do, must be part of iron, part of clay;--foul or mechanical
work is always reduced by a noble race to the minimum in quantity; and, even then, performed
and endured, not without sense of degradation, as a fine temper is wounded by the sight of
the lower offices of the body. The highest conditions of human society reached hitherto have
cast such work to slaves; but supposing slavery of a politically defined kind to be done away
with, mechanical and foul employment must, in all highly organized states, take the aspect
either of punishment or probation. All criminals should at once be set to the most dangerous
and painful forms of it, especially to work in mines and at furnaces,[56] so as to relieve
the innocent population as far as possible: of merely rough (not mechanical) manual labour,
especially agricultural, a large portion should be done by the upper classes;--bodily health,
and sufficient contrast and repose for the mental functions, being unattainable without it;
what necessarily inferior labour remains to be done, as especially in manufactures, should,
and always will, when the relations of society are reverent and harmonious, fall to the lot
of those who, for the time, are fit for nothing better. For as, whatever the perfectness of
the educational system, there must remain infinite differences between the natures and capacities
of men; and these differing natures are generally rangeable under the two qualities of lordly,
(or tending towards rule, construction, and harmony), and servile (or tending towards misrule,
destruction, and discord); and since the lordly part is only in a state of profitableness while
ruling, and the servile only in a state of redeemableness while serving, the whole health of
the state depends on the manifest separation of these two elements of its mind; for, if the
servile part be not separated and rendered visible in service, it mixes with, and corrupts,
the entire body of the state; and if the lordly part be not distinguished, and set to rule,
it is crushed and lost, being turned to no account, so that the rarest qualities of the nation
are all given to it in vain.[57]

II. LAWS.

110. These are the definitions and bonds of custom, or of what the nation desires should become
custom.

Law is either archic,[58] (of direction), meristic, (of division), or critic, (of judgment).

Archic law is that of appointment and precept: it defines what is and is not to be done.

Meristic law is that of balance and distribution: it defines what is and is not to be possessed.

Critic law is that of discernment and award: it defines what is and is not to be suffered.

111. A. ARCHIC LAW. If we choose to unite the laws of precept and distribution under the head
of "statutes," all law is simply either of statute or judgment; that is, first the establishment
of ordinance, and, secondly, the assignment of the reward, or penalty, due to its observance
or violation.

To some extent these two forms of law must be associated, and, with every ordinance, the penalty
of disobedience to it be also determined. But since the degrees and guilt of disobedience vary,
the determination of due reward and punishment must be modified by discernment of special fact,
which is peculiarly the office of the judge, as distinguished from that of the lawgiver and
law-sustainer, or king; not but that the two offices are always theoretically, and in early
stages, or limited numbers, of society, are often practically, united in the same person or
persons.

112. Also, it is necessary to keep clearly in view the distinction between these two kinds
of law, because the possible range of law is wider in proportion to their separation. There
are many points of conduct respecting which the nation may wisely express its will by a written
precept or resolve, yet not enforce it by penalty:[59] and the expedient degree of penalty
is always quite a separate consideration from the expedience of the statute; for the statute
may often be better enforced by mercy than severity, and is also easier in the bearing, and
less likely to be abrogated. Farther, laws of precept have reference especially to youth, and
concern themselves with training; but laws of judgment to manhood, and concern themselves with
remedy and reward. There is a highly curious feeling in the English mind against educational
law: we think no man's liberty should be interfered with till he has done irrevocable wrong;
whereas it is then just too late for the only gracious and kingly interference, which is to
hinder him from doing it. Make your educational laws strict, and your criminal ones may be
gentle; but, leave youth its liberty and you will have to dig dungeons for age. And it is good
for a man that he "wear the yoke in his youth:" for the reins may then be of silken thread;
and with sweet chime of silver bells at the bridle; but, for the captivity of age, you must
forge the iron fetter, and cast the passing bell.

113. Since no law can be, in a final or true sense, established, but by right, (all unjust
laws involving the ultimate necessity of their own abrogation), the law-giving can only become
a law-sustaining power in so far as it is Royal, or "right doing;"--in so far, that is, as
it rules, not misrules, and orders, not dis-orders, the things submitted to it. Throned on
this rock of justice, the kingly power becomes established and establishing; "[Greek: theios],"
or divine, and, therefore, it is literally true that no ruler can err, so long as he is a ruler,
or [Greek: archôn oudeis amartanei tote hotan archôn ê]; perverted by careless thought, which
has cost the world somewhat, into--"the king can do no wrong."

114. B. MERISTIC LAW,[60] or that of the tenure of property, first determines what every individual
possesses by right, and secures it to him; and what he possesses by wrong, and deprives him
of it. But it has a far higher provisory function: it determines what every man should possess,
and puts it within his reach on due conditions; and what he should not possess, and puts this
out of his reach, conclusively.

115. Every article of human wealth has certain conditions attached to its merited possession;
when these are unobserved, possession becomes rapine. And the object of meristic law is not
only to secure to every man his rightful share (the share, that is, which he has worked for,
produced, or received by gift from a rightful owner), but to enforce the due conditions of
possession, as far as law may conveniently reach; for instance, that land shall not be wantonly
allowed to run to waste, that streams shall not be poisoned by the persons through whose properties
they pass, nor air be rendered unwholesome beyond given limits. Laws of this kind exist already
in rudimentary degree, but need large development; the just laws respecting the possession
of works of art have not hitherto been so much as conceived, and the daily loss of national
wealth, and of its use, in this respect, is quite incalculable. And these laws need revision
quite as much respecting property in national as in private hands. For instance: the public
are under a vague impression that, because they have paid for the contents of the British Museum,
every one has an equal right to see and to handle them. But the public have similarly paid
for the contents of Woolwich arsenal; yet do not expect free access to it, or handling of its
contents. The British Museum is neither a free circulating library, nor a free school: it is
a place for the safe preservation, and exhibition on due occasion, of unique books, unique
objects of natural history, and unique works of art; its books can no more be used by everybody
than its coins can be handled, or its statues cast. There ought to be free libraries in every
quarter of London, with large and complete reading-rooms attached; so also free educational
museums should be open in every quarter of London, all day long, until late at night, well
lighted, well catalogued, and rich in contents both of art and natural history. But neither
the British Museum nor National Gallery is a school; they are treasuries; and both should be
severely restricted in access and in use. Unless some order of this kind is made, and that
soon, for the MSS. department of the Museum, (its superintendents have sorrowfully told me
this, and repeatedly), the best MSS. in the collection will be destroyed, irretrievably, by
the careless and continual handling to which they are now subjected.

Finally, in certain conditions of a nation's progress, laws limiting accumulation of any kind
of property may be found expedient.

116. C. CRITIC LAW determines questions of injury, and assigns due rewards and punishments
to conduct.

Two curious economical questions arise laterally with respect to this branch of law, namely,
the cost of crime, and the cost of judgment. The cost of crime is endured by nations ignorantly,
that expense being nowhere stated in their budgets; the cost of judgment, patiently, (provided
only it can be had pure for the money), because the science, or perhaps we ought rather to
say the art, of law, is felt to found a noble profession and discipline; so that civilized
nations are usually glad that a number of persons should be supported by exercise in oratory
and analysis. But it has not yet been calculated what the practical value might have been,
in other directions, of the intelligence now occupied in deciding, through courses of years,
what might have been decided as justly, had the date of judgment been fixed, in as many hours.
Imagine one half of the funds which any great nation devotes to dispute by law, applied to
the determination of physical questions in medicine, agriculture, and theoretic science; and
calculate the probable results within the next ten years!

I say nothing yet of the more deadly, more lamentable loss, involved in the use of purchased,
instead of personal, justice--[Greek: "epaktô par allôn--aporia oikeiôn."]

117. In order to true analysis of critic law, we must understand the real meaning of the word
"injury."

We commonly understand by it, any kind of harm done by one man to another; but we do not define
the idea of harm: sometimes we limit it to the harm which the sufferer is conscious of; whereas
much the worst injuries are those he is unconscious of; and, at other times, we limit the idea
to violence, or restraint; whereas much the worse forms of injury are to be accomplished by
indolence, and the withdrawal of restraint.

118. "Injury" is then simply the refusal, or violation of, any man's right or claim upon his
fellows: which claim, much talked of in modern times, under the term "right," is mainly resolvable
into two branches: a man's claim not to be hindered from doing what he should; and his claim
to be hindered from doing what he should not; these two forms of hindrance being intensified
by reward, help, and fortune, or Fors, on one side, and by punishment, impediment, and even
final arrest, or Mors, on the other.

119. Now, in order to a man's obtaining these two rights, it is clearly needful that the worth
of him should be approximately known; as well as the want of worth, which has, unhappily, been
usually the principal subject of study for critic law, careful hitherto only to mark degrees
of de-merit, instead of merit;--assigning, indeed, to the Deficiencies (not always, alas! even
to these) just estimate, fine, or penalty; but to the Efficiencies, on the other side, which
are by much the more interesting, as well as the only profitable part of its subject, assigning
neither estimate nor aid.

120. Now, it is in this higher and perfect function of critic law, enabling instead of disabling,
that it becomes truly Kingly, instead of Draconic: (what Providence gave the great, wrathful
legislator his name?): that is, it becomes the law of man and of life, instead of the law of
the worm and of death--both of these laws being set in changeless poise one against another,
and the enforcement of both being the eternal function of the lawgiver, and true claim of every
living soul: such claim being indeed strong to be mercifully hindered, and even, if need be,
abolished, when longer existence means only deeper destruction, but stronger still to be mercifully
helped, and recreated, when longer existence and new creation mean nobler life. So that reward
and punishment will be found to resolve themselves mainly[61] into help and hindrance; and
these again will issue naturally from time recognition of deserving, and the just reverence
and just wrath which follow instinctively on such recognition.

121. I say, "follow," but, in reality, they are part of the recognition. Reverence is as instinctive
as anger;--both of them instant on true vision: it is sight and understanding that we have
to teach, and these are reverence. Make a man perceive worth, and in its reflection he sees
his own relative unworth, and worships thereupon inevitably, not with stiff courtesy, but rejoicingly,
passionately, and, best of all, restfully: for the inner capacity of awe and love is infinite
in man, and only in finding these, can we find peace. And the common insolences and petulances
of the people, and their talk of equality, are not irreverence in them in the least, but mere
blindness, stupefaction, and fog in the brains,[62] the first sign of any cleansing away of
which is, that they gain some power of discerning, and some patience in submitting to, their
true counsellors and governors. In the mode of such discernment consists the real "constitution"
of the state, more than in the titles or offices of the discerned person; for it is no matter,
save in degree of mischief, to what office a man is appointed, if he cannot fulfil it.

122. III. GOVERNMENT BY COUNCIL.

This is the determination, by living authority, of the national conduct to be observed under
existing circumstances; and the modification or enlargement, abrogation or enforcement, of
the code of national law according to present needs or purposes. This government is necessarily
always by council, for though the authority of it may be vested in one person, that person
cannot form any opinion on a matter of public interest but by (voluntarily or involuntarily)
submitting himself to the influence of others.

This government is always twofold--visible and invisible.

The visible government is that which nominally carries on the national business; determines
its foreign relations, raises taxes, levies soldiers, orders war or peace, and otherwise becomes
the arbiter of the national fortune. The invisible government is that exercised by all energetic
and intelligent men, each in his sphere, regulating the inner will and secret ways of the people,
essentially forming its character, and preparing its fate.

Visible governments are the toys of some nations, the diseases of others, the harness of some,
the burdens of more the necessity of all. Sometimes their career is quite distinct from that
of the people, and to write it, as the national history, is as if one should number the accidents
which befall a man's weapons and wardrobe, and call the list his biography. Nevertheless, a
truly noble and wise nation necessarily has a noble and wise visible government, for its wisdom
issues in that conclusively.

123. Visible governments are, in their agencies, capable of three pure forms, and of no more
than three.

They are either monarchies, where the authority is vested in one person; oligarchies, when
it is vested in a minority; or democracies, when vested in a majority.

But these three forms are not only, in practice, variously limited and combined, but capable
of infinite difference in character and use, receiving specific names according to their variations;
which names, being nowise agreed upon, nor consistently used, either in thought or writing,
no man can at present tell, in speaking of any kind of government, whether he is understood;
nor, in hearing, whether he understands. Thus we usually call a just government by one person
a monarchy, and an unjust or cruel one, a tyranny: this might be reasonable if it had reference
to the divinity of true government; but to limit the term "oligarchy" to government by a few
rich people, and to call government by a few wise or noble people "aristocracy," is evidently
absurd, unless it were proved that rich people never could be wise, or noble people rich; and
farther absurd, because there are other distinctions in character, as well as riches or wisdom
(greater purity of race, or strength of purpose, for instance), which may give the power of
government to the few. So that if we had to give names to every group or kind of minority,
we should have verbiage enough. But there is only one right name--"oligarchy."

124. So also the terms "republic" and "democracy"[63] are confused, especially in modern use;
and both of them are liable to every sort of misconception. A republic means, properly, a polity
in which the state, with its all, is at every man's service, and every man, with his all, at
the state's service--(people are apt to lose sight of the last condition), but its government
may nevertheless be oligarchic (consular, or decemviral, for instance), or monarchic (dictatorial).
But a democracy means a state in which the government rests directly with the majority of the
citizens. And both these conditions have been judged only by such accidents and aspects of
them as each of us has had experience of; and sometimes both have been confused with anarchy,
as it is the fashion at present to talk of the "failure of republican institutions in America,"
when there has never yet been in America any such thing as an institution, but only defiance
of institution; neither any such thing as a res-publica, but only a multitudinous res-privata;
every man for himself. It is not republicanism which fails now in America; it is your model
science of political economy, brought to its perfect practice. There you may see competition,
and the "law of demand and supply" (especially in paper), in beautiful and unhindered operation.[64]
Lust of wealth, and trust in it; vulgar faith in magnitude and multitude, instead of nobleness;
besides that faith natural to backwoodsmen--"lucum ligna,"[65]--perpetual self-contemplation,
issuing in passionate vanity; total ignorance of the finer and higher arts, and of all that
they teach and bestow; and the discontent of energetic minds unoccupied, frantic with hope
of uncomprehended change, and progress they know not whither;[66]--these are the things that
have "failed" in America; and yet not altogether failed--it is not collapse, but collision;
the greatest railroad accident on record, with fire caught from the furnace, and Catiline's
quenching "non aquâ, sed ruinâ."[67] But I see not, in any of our talk of them, justice enough
done to their erratic strength of purpose, nor any estimate taken of the strength of endurance
of domestic sorrow, in what their women and children suppose a righteous cause. And out of
that endurance and suffering, its own fruit will be born with time; [not abolition of slavery,
however. See § 130.] and Carlyle's prophecy of them (June, 1850), as it has now come true in
the first clause, will, in the last:--

"America, too, will find that caucuses, divisionalists, stump-oratory, and speeches to Buncombe
will not carry men to the immortal gods; that the Washington Congress, and constitutional battle
of Kilkenny cats is there, as here, naught for such objects; quite incompetent for such; and,
in fine, that said sublime constitutional arrangement will require to be (with terrible throes,
and travail such as few expect yet) remodelled, abridged, extended, suppressed, torn asunder,
put together again--not without heroic labour and effort, quite other than that of the stump-orator
and the revival preacher, one day."

125.[68] Understand, then, once for all, that no form of government, provided it be a government
at all, is, as such, to be either condemned or praised, or contested for in anywise, but by
fools. But all forms of government are good just so far as they attain this one vital necessity
of policy--that the wise and kind, few or many, shall govern the unwise and unkind; and they
are evil so far as they miss of this, or reverse it. Not does the form, in any case, signify
one whit, but its firmness, and adaptation to the need; for if there be many foolish persons
in a state, and few wise, then it is good that the few govern; and if there be many wise, and
few foolish, then it is good that the many govern; and if many be wise, yet one wiser, then
it is good that one should govern; and so on. Thus, we may have "the ant's republic, and the
realm of bees," both good in their kind; one for groping, and the other for building; and nobler
still, for flying;--the Ducal monarchy[69] of those

    Intelligent of seasons, that set forth
    The aery caravan, high over seas.

126. Nor need we want examples, among the inferior creatures, of dissoluteness, as well as
resoluteness, in government. I once saw democracy finely illustrated by the beetles of North
Switzerland, who by universal suffrage, and elytric acclamation, one May twilight, carried
it, that they would fly over the Lake of Zug; and flew short, to the great disfigurement of
the Lake of Zug,--[Greek: Kantharon limên]--over some leagues square, and to the close of the
cockchafer democracy for that year. Then, for tyranny, the old fable of the frogs and the stork
finely touches one form of it; but truth will image it more closely than fable, for tyranny
is not complete when it is only over the idle, but when it is over the laborious and the blind.
This description of pelicans and climbing perch, which I find quoted in one of our popular
natural histories, out of Sir Emerson Tennant's Ceylon, comes as near as may be to the true
image of the thing:--

"Heavy rains came on, and as we stood on the high ground, we observed a pelican on the margin
of the shallow pool gorging himself; our people went towards him, and raised a cry of 'Fish,
fish!' We hurried down, and found numbers of fish struggling upward through the grass, in the
rills formed by the trickling of the rain. There was scarcely water to cover them, but nevertheless
they made rapid progress up the bank, on which our followers collected about two baskets of
them. They were forcing their way up the knoll, and had they not been interrupted, first by
the pelican, and afterwards by ourselves, they would in a few minutes have gained the highest
point, and descended on the other side into a pool which formed another portion of the tank.
In going this distance, however, they must have used muscular exertion enough to have taken
them half a mile on level ground; for at these places all the cattle and wild animals of the
neighbourhood had latterly come to drink, so that the surface was everywhere indented with
footmarks, in addition to the cracks in the surrounding baked mud, into which the fish tumbled
in their progress. In those holes, which were deep, and the sides perpendicular, they remained
to die, and were carried off by kites and crows."[70]

127. But whether governments be bad or good, one general disadvantage seems to attach to them
in modern times--that they are all costly.[71] This, however, is not essentially the fault
of the governments. If nations choose to play at war, they will always find their governments
willing to lead the game, and soon coming under that term of Aristophanes, "[Greek: kapêloi
aspidôn]," "shield-sellers." And when ([Greek: pêm epi pêmati])[72] the shields take the form
of iron ships, with apparatus "for defence against liquid fire,"--as I see by latest accounts
they are now arranging the decks in English dockyards--they become costly biers enough for
the grey convoy of chief mourner waves, wreathed with funereal foam, to bear back the dead
upon; the massy shoulders of those corpse-bearers being intended for quite other work, and
to bear the living, and food for the living, if we would let them.

128. Nor have we the least right to complain of our governments being expensive, so long as
we set the government to do precisely the work which brings no return. If our present doctrines
of political economy be just, let us trust them to the utmost; take that war business out of
the government's hands, and test therein the principles of supply and demand. Let our future
sieges of Sebastopol be done by contract--no capture, no pay--(I admit that things might sometimes
go better so); and let us sell the commands of our prospective battles, with our vicarages,
to the lowest bidder; so may we have cheap victories, and divinity. On the other hand, if we
have so much suspicion of our science that we dare not trust it on military or spiritual business,
would it not be but reasonable to try whether some authoritative handling may not prosper in
matters utilitarian? If we were to set our governments to do useful things instead of mischievous,
possibly even the apparatus itself might in time come to be less costly. The machine, applied
to the building of the house, might perhaps pay, when it seems not to pay, applied to pulling
it down. If we made in our dockyards ships to carry timber and coals, instead of cannon, and
with provision for the brightening of domestic solid culinary fire, instead of for the scattering
of liquid hostile fire, it might have some effect on the taxes. Or suppose that we tried the
experiment on land instead of water carriage; already the government, not unapproved, carries
letters and parcels for us; larger packages may in time follow;--even general merchandise--why
not, at last, ourselves? Had the money spent in local mistakes and vain private litigation,
on the railroads of England, been laid out, instead, under proper government restraint, on
really useful railroad work, and had no absurd expense been incurred in ornamenting stations,
we might already have had,--what ultimately it will be found we must have,--quadruple rails,
two for passengers, and two for traffic, on every great line; and we might have been carried
in swift safety, and watched and warded by well-paid pointsmen, for half the present fares.
[For, of course, a railroad company is merely an association of turnpike-keepers, who make
the tolls as high as they can, not to mend the roads with, but to pocket. The public will in
time discover this, and do away with turnpikes on railroads, as on all other public-ways.]

129. Suppose it should thus turn out, finally, that a true government set to true work, instead
of being a costly engine, was a paying one? that your government, rightly organized, instead
of itself subsisting by an income-tax, would produce its subjects some subsistence in the shape
of an income dividend?--police, and judges duly paid besides, only with less work than the
state at present provides for them.

A true government set to true work!--Not easily to be imagined, still less obtained; but not
beyond human hope or ingenuity. Only you will have to alter your election systems somewhat,
first. Not by universal suffrage, nor by votes purchasable with beer, is such government to
be had. That is to say, not by universal equal suffrage. Every man upwards of twenty, who has
been convicted of no legal crime, should have his say in this matter; but afterwards a louder
voice, as he grows older, and approves himself wiser. If he has one vote at twenty, he should
have two at thirty, four at forty, ten at fifty. For every single vote which he has with an
income of a hundred a year, he should have ten with an income of a thousand, (provided you
first see to it that wealth is, as nature intended it to be, the reward of sagacity and industry--not
of good luck in a scramble or a lottery). For every single vote which he had as subordinate
in any business, he should have two when he became a master; and every office and authority
nationally bestowed, implying trustworthiness and intellect, should have its known proportional
number of votes attached to it. But into the detail and working of a true system in these matters
we cannot now enter; we are concerned as yet with definitions only, and statements of first
principles, which will be established now sufficiently for our purposes when we have examined
the nature of that form of government last on the list in § 105,--the purely "Magistral," exciting
at present its full share of public notice, under its ambiguous title of "slavery."

130. I have not, however, been able to ascertain in definite terms, from the declaimers against
slavery, what they understand by it. If they mean only the imprisonment or compulsion of one
person by another, such imprisonment or compulsion being in many cases highly expedient, slavery,
so defined, would be no evil in itself, but only in its abuse; that is, when men are slaves,
who should not be, or masters, who should not be, or even the fittest characters for either
state, placed in it under conditions which should not be. It is not, for instance, a necessary
condition of slavery, nor a desirable one, that parents should be separated from children,
or husbands from wives; but the institution of war, against which people declaim with less
violence, effects such separations,--not unfrequently in a very permanent manner. To press
a sailor, seize a white youth by conscription for a soldier, or carry off a black one for a
labourer, may all be right acts, or all wrong ones, according to needs and circumstances. It
is wrong to scourge a man unnecessarily. So it is to shoot him. Both must be done on occasion;
and it is better and kinder to flog a man to his work, than to leave him idle till he robs,
and flog him afterwards. The essential thing for all creatures is to be made to do right; how
they are made to do it--by pleasant promises, or hard necessities, pathetic oratory, or the
whip--is comparatively immaterial.[73] To be deceived is perhaps as incompatible with human
dignity as to be whipped; and I suspect the last method to be not the worst, for the help of
many individuals. The Jewish nation throve under it, in the hand of a monarch reputed not unwise;
it is only the change of whip for scorpion which is inexpedient; and that change is as likely
to come to pass on the side of license as of law. For the true scorpion whips are those of
the nation's pleasant vices, which are to it as St. John's locusts--crown on the head, ravin
in the mouth, and sting in the tail. If it will not bear the rule of Athena and Apollo, who
shepherd without smiting ([Greek: ou plêgê nemontes]), Athena at last calls no more in the
corners of the streets; and then follows the rule of Tisiphone, who smites without shepherding.

131. If, however, by slavery, instead of absolute compulsion, is meant the purchase, by money,
of the right of compulsion, such purchase is necessarily made whenever a portion of any territory
is transferred, for money, from one monarch to another: which has happened frequently enough
in history, without its being supposed that the inhabitants of the districts so transferred
became therefore slaves. In this, as in the former case, the dispute seems about the fashion
of the thing, rather than the fact of it. There are two rocks in mid-sea, on each of which,
neglected equally by instructive and commercial powers, a handful of inhabitants live as they
may. Two merchants bid for the two properties, but not in the same terms. One bids for the
people, buys them, and sets them to work, under pain of scourge; the other bids for the rock,
buys it, and throws the inhabitants into the sea. The former is the American, the latter the
English method, of slavery; much is to be said for, and something against, both, which I hope
to say in due time and place.[74]

132. If, however, slavery mean not merely the purchase of the right of compulsion, but the
purchase of the body and soul of the creature itself for money, it is not, I think, among the
black races that purchases of this kind are most extensively made, or that separate souls of
a fine make fetch the highest price. This branch of the inquiry we shall have occasion also
to follow out at some length, for in the worst instances of the selling of souls, we are apt
to get, when we ask if the sale is valid, only Pyrrhon's answer[75]--"None can know."

133. The fact is that slavery is not a political institution at all, but an inherent, natural,
and eternal inheritance of a large portion of the human race--to whom, the more you give of
their own free will, the more slaves they will make themselves. In common parlance, we idly
confuse captivity with slavery, and are always thinking of the difference between pine-trunks
(Ariel in the pine), and cowslip-bells ("in the cowslip-bell I lie"), or between carrying wood
and drinking (Caliban's slavery and freedom), instead of noting the far more serious differences
between Ariel and Caliban themselves, and the means by which, practically, that difference
may be brought about or diminished.

134.[76] Plato's slave, in the Polity, who, well dressed and washed, aspires to the hand of
his master's daughter, corresponds curiously to Caliban attacking Prospero's cell; and there
is an undercurrent of meaning throughout, in the Tempest as well as in the Merchant of Venice;
referring in this case to government, as in that to commerce. Miranda[77] ("the wonderful,"
so addressed first by Ferdinand, "Oh, you wonder!") corresponds to Homer's Arete: Ariel and
Caliban are respectively the spirits of faithful and imaginative labour, opposed to rebellious,
hurtful and slavish labour. Prospero ("for hope"), a true governor, is opposed to Sycorax,
the mother of slavery, her name "Swine-raven," indicating at once brutality and deathfulness;
hence the line--

    "As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed, with raven's feather,"--&c.

For all these dreams of Shakespeare, as those of true and strong men must be, are "[Greek:
phantasmata theia, kai skiai tôn ontôn]"--divine phantasms, and shadows of things that are.
We hardly tell our children, willingly, a fable with no purport in it; yet we think God sends
his best messengers only to sing fairy tales to us, fond and empty. The Tempest is just like
a grotesque in a rich missal, "clasped where paynims pray." Ariel is the spirit of generous
and free-hearted service, in early stages of human society oppressed by ignorance and wild
tyranny: venting groans as fast as mill-wheels strike; in shipwreck of states, dreadful; so
that "all but mariners plunge in the brine, and quit the vessel, then all afire with me," yet
having in itself the will and sweetness of truest peace, whence that is especially called "Ariel's"
song, "Come unto these yellow sands, and there, take hands," "courtesied when you have, and
kissed, the wild waves whist:" (mind, it is "cortesia," not "curtsey,") and read "quiet" for
"whist," if you want the full sense. Then you may indeed foot it featly, and sweet spirits
bear the burden for you--with watch in the night, and call in early morning. Then, giving rest
after labour, it "fetches dew from the still vext Bermoöthes, and, with a charm joined to their
suffered labour, leaves men asleep." Snatching away the feast of the cruel, it seems to them
as a harpy; followed by the utterly vile, who cannot see it in any shape, but to whom it is
the picture of nobody, it still gives shrill harmony to their false and mocking catch, "Thought
is free;" but leads them into briers and foul places, and at last hollas the hounds upon them.
Minister of fate against the great criminal, it joins itself with the "incensed seas and shores
"--the sword that layeth at it cannot hold, and may "with bemocked-at stabs as soon kill the
still-closing waters, as diminish one dowle that is in its plume." As the guide and aid of
true love, it is always called by Prospero "fine" (the French "fine," not the English), or
"delicate"--another long note would be needed to explain all the meaning in this word. Lastly,
its work done, and war, it resolves itself into the elements. The intense significance of the
last song, "Where the bee sucks," I will examine in its due place.

The types of slavery in Caliban are more palpable, and need not be dwelt on now: though I will
notice them also, severally, in their proper places;--the heart of his slavery is in his worship:
"That's a brave god, and bears celestial--liquor." But, in illustration of the sense in which
the Latin "benignus" and "malignus" are to be coupled with Eleutheria and Douleia, note that
Caliban's torment is always the physical reflection of his own nature--"cramps" and "side stiches
that shall pen thy breath up; thou shalt be pinched, as thick as honeycombs:" the whole nature
of slavery being one cramp and cretinous contraction. Fancy this of Ariel! You may fetter him,
but you set no mark on him; you may put him to hard work and far journey, but you cannot give
him a cramp.

135. I should dwell, even in these prefatory papers, at more length on this subject of slavery,
had not all I would say been said already, in vain, (not, as I hope, ultimately in vain), by
Carlyle, in the first of the Latter-day Pamphlets, which I commend to the reader's gravest
reading; together with that as much neglected, and still more immediately needed, on model
prisons, and with the great chapter on "Permanence" (fifth of the last section of "Past and
Present"), which sums what is known, and foreshadows, or rather forelights, all that is to
be learned of National Discipline. I have only here farther to examine the nature of one world-wide
and everlasting form of slavery, wholesome in use, as deadly in abuse;--the service of the
rich by the poor.

FOOTNOTES:

[54] [Think over this paragraph carefully; it should have been much expanded to be quite intelligible;
but it contains all that I want it to contain.]

[55] "The ordinary brute, who flourishes in the very centre of ornate life, tells us of unknown
depths on the verge of which we totter, being bound to thank our stars every day we live that
there is not a general outbreak, and a revolt from the yoke of civilization."--Times leader,
Dec. 25, 1862. Admitting that our stars are to be thanked for our safety, whom are we to thank
for the danger?

[56] Our politicians, even the best of them, regard only the distress caused by the failure
of mechanical labour. The degradation caused by its excess is a far more serious subject of
thought, and of future fear. I shall examine this part of our subject at length hereafter.
There can hardly be any doubt, at present, cast on the truth of the above passages, as all
the great thinkers are unanimous on the matter. Plato's words are terrific in their scorn and
pity whenever he touches on the mechanical arts. He calls the men employed in them not even
human, but partially and diminutively human, "[Greek: anthrôpiskoi,]" and opposes such work
to noble occupations, not merely as prison is opposed to freedom but as a convict's dishonoured
prison is to the temple (escape from them being like that of a criminal to the sanctuary);
and the destruction caused by them being of soul no less than body.--Rep. vi. 9. Compare Laws,
v. 11. Xenophon dwells on the evil of occupations at the furnace and especially their "[Greek:
ascholia], want of leisure."--Econ. i. 4. (Modern England, with all its pride of education,
has lost that first sense of the word "school;" and till it recover that, it will find no other
rightly.) His word for the harm to the soul is to "break" it, as we say of the heart.--Econ.
i. 6. And herein, also, is the root of the scorn, otherwise apparently most strange and cruel,
with which Homer, Dante, and Shakspeare always speak of the populace; for it is entirely true
that, in great states, the lower orders are low by nature as well as by task, being precisely
that part of the commonwealth which has been thrust down for its coarseness or unworthiness
(by coarseness I mean especially insensibility and irreverence--the "profane" of Horace); and
when this ceases to be so, and the corruption and profanity are in the higher instead of the
lower orders, there arises, first, helpless confusion, then, if the lower classes deserve power,
ensues swift revolution, and they get it; but if neither the populace nor their rulers deserve
it, there follows mere darkness and dissolution, till, out of the putrid elements, some new
capacity of order rises, like grass on a grave; if not, there is no more hope, nor shadow of
turning, for that nation. Atropos has her way with it.

So that the law of national health is like that of a great lake or sea, in perfect but slow
circulation, letting the dregs fall continually to the lowest place, and the clear water rise;
yet so as that there shall be no neglect of the lower orders, but perfect supervision and sympathy,
so that if one member suffer, all members shall suffer with it.

[57] "[Greek: oligês, kai allôs gignomenês]." (Little, and that little born in vain.) The bitter
sentence never was so true as at this day.

[58] [This following note is a mere cluster of memoranda, but I keep it for reference.] Thetic,
or Thesmic, would perhaps be a better term than archic; but liable to be confused with some
which we shall want relating to Theoria. The administrators of the three great divisions of
law are severally Archons, Merists, and Dicasts. The Archons are the true princes, or beginners
of things; or leaders (as of an orchestra). The Merists are properly the Domini, or Lords of
houses and nations. The Dicasts, properly, the judges, and that with Olympian justice, which
reaches to heaven and hell. The violation of archic law is [Greek: hamartia] (error), [Greek:
ponêria] (failure), or [Greek: plêmmeleia] (discord). The violation of meristic law is [Greek:
anomia] (iniquity). The violation of critic law is [Greek: adikia] (injury). Iniquity is the
central generic term; for all law is fatal; it is the division to men of their fate; as the
fold of their pasture, it is [Greek: nomos]; as the assigning of their portion, [Greek: moira].

[59] [This is the only sentence which, in revising these essays, I am now inclined to question;
but the point is one of extreme difficulty. There might be a law, for instance, of curfew,
that candles should be put out, unless for necessary service, at such and such an hour, the
idea of "necessary service" being quite indefinable, and no penalty possible; yet there would
be a distinct consciousness of illegal conduct in young ladies' minds who danced by candlelight
till dawn.]

[60] [Read this and the next paragraph with attention; they contain clear statements, which
I cannot mend, of things most necessary.]

[61] [Mainly; not altogether. Conclusive reward of high virtue is loving and crowning, not
helping; and conclusive punishment of deep vice is hating and crushing, not merely hindering.]

[62] Compare Chaucer's "villany" (clownishness).

    Full foul and chorlishe seemed she,
    And eke villanous for to be,
    And little coulde of norture
    To worship any creature.

[63] [I leave this paragraph, in every syllable, as it was written, during the rage of the
American war; it was meant to refer, however, chiefly to the Northerns: what modifications
its hot and partial terms require I will give in another place: let it stand now as it stood.]

[64] Supply and demand! Alas! for what noble work was there ever any audible "demand" in that
poor sense (Past and Present)? Nay, the demand is not loud, even for ignoble work. See "Average
Earnings of Betty Taylor," in Times of 4th February of this year [1863]: "Worked from Monday
morning at 8 A.M. to Friday night at 5.30 P.M. for 1s. 5-1/2d."--Laissez faire. [This kind
of slavery finds no Abolitionists that I hear of.]

[65] ["That the sacred grove is nothing but logs."]

[66] Ames, by report of Waldo Emerson, says "that a monarchy is a merchantman, which sails
well, but will sometimes strike on a rock, and go to the bottom; whilst a republic is a raft,
which would never sink, but then your feet are always in the water." Yes, that is comfortable;
and though your raft cannot sink (being too worthless for that), it may go to pieces, I suppose,
when the four winds (your only pilots) steer competitively from its four corners, and carry
it, [Greek: ôs opôrinos Boreês phoreêsin akanthas], and then more than your feet will be in
the water.

[67] ["Not with water, but with ruin." The worst ruin being that which the Americans chiefly
boast of. They sent all their best and honestest youths, Harvard University men and the like,
to that accursed war; got them nearly all shot; wrote pretty biographies (to the ages of 17,
18, 19) and epitaphs for them; and so, having washed all the salt out of the nation in blood,
left themselves to putrefaction, and the morality of New York.]

[68] [This paragraph contains the gist of all that precede.]

[69] [Whenever you are puzzled by any apparently mistaken use of words in these essays, take
your dictionary, remembering I had to fix terms, as well as principles. A Duke is a "dux" or
"leader;" the flying wedge of cranes is under a "ducal monarch"--a very different personage
from a queen bee. The Venetians, with a beautiful instinct, gave the name to their King of
the Sea.]

[70] [This is a perfect picture of the French under the tyrannies of their Pelican Kings, before
the Revolution. But they must find other than Pelican Kings--or rather, Pelican Kings of the
Divine brood, that feed their children, and with their best blood.]

[71] [Read carefully, from this point; because here begins the statement of things requiring
to be done, which I am now re-trying to make definite in Fors Clavigera.]

[72] ["Evil on the top of Evil." Delphic oracle, meaning iron on the anvil.]

[73] [Permit me to enforce and reinforce this statement, with all earnestness. It is the sum
of what needs most to be understood in the matter of education.]

[74] [A pregnant paragraph, meant against English and Scotch landlords who drive their people
off the land.]

[75] [In Lucian's dialogue, "The sale of lives."]

[76] [I raise this analysis of the Tempest into my text; but it is nothing but a hurried note,
which I may never have time to expand. I have retouched it here and there a little, however.]

[77] Of Shakspeare's names I will afterwards speak at more length; they are curiously--often
barbarously--much by Providence,--but assuredly not without Shakspeare's cunning purpose--mixed
out of the various traditions he confusedly adopted, and languages which he imperfectly knew.
Three of the clearest in meaning have been already noticed. Desdemona, "[Greek: dysdaimonia],"
"miserable fortune," is also plain enough. Othello is, I believe, "the careful;" all the calamity
of the tragedy arising from the single flaw and error in his magnificently collected strength.
Ophelia, "serviceableness," the true lost wife of Hamlet, is marked as having a Greek name
by that of her brother, Laertes; and its signification is once exquisitely alluded to in that
brother's last word of her, where her gentle preciousness is opposed to the uselessness of
the churlish clergy--"A ministering angel shall my sister be, when thou liest howling." Hamlet
is, I believe, connected in some way with "homely" the entire event of the tragedy turning
on betrayal of home duty. Hermione ([Greek: erma]), "pillar-like," ([Greek: hê eidos eche chrysês
'Aphroditês]). Titania ([Greek: titênê]), "the queen;" Benedict and Beatrice, "blessed and

CHAPTER VI.

MASTERSHIP.

136. As in all previous discussions of our subject, we must study the relation of the commanding
rich to the obeying poor in its simplest elements, in order to reach its first principles.

The simplest state of it, then, is this:[78] a wise and provident person works much, consumes
little, and lays by a store; an improvident person works little, consumes all his produce,
and lays by no store. Accident interrupts the daily work, or renders it less productive; the
idle person must then starve, or be supported by the provident one, who, having him thus at
his mercy, may either refuse to maintain him altogether, or, which will evidently be more to
his own interest, say to him, "I will maintain you, indeed, but you shall now work hard, instead
of indolently, and instead of being allowed to lay by what you save, as you might have done,
had you remained independent, I will take all the surplus. You would not lay it up for yourself;
it is wholly your own fault that has thrown you into my power, and I will force you to work,
or starve; yet you shall have no profit of your work, only your daily bread for it; [and competition
shall determine how much of that[79]]." This mode of treatment has now become so universal
that it is supposed to be the only natural--nay, the only possible one; and the market wages
are calmly defined by economists as "the sum which will maintain the labourer."

137. The power of the provident person to do this is only checked by the correlative power
of some neighbour of similarly frugal habits, who says to the labourer--"I will give you a
little more than this other provident person: come and work for me."

The power of the provident over the improvident depends thus, primarily, on their relative
numbers; secondarily, on the modes of agreement of the adverse parties with each other. The
accidental level of wages is a variable function of the number of provident and idle persons
in the world, of the enmity between them as classes, and of the agreement between those of
the same class. It depends, from beginning to end, on moral conditions.

138. Supposing the rich to be entirely selfish, it is always for their interest that the poor
should be as numerous as they can employ, and restrain. For, granting that the entire population
is no larger than the ground can easily maintain--that the classes are stringently divided--and
that there is sense or strength of hand enough with the rich to secure obedience; then, if
nine-tenths of a nation are poor, the remaining tenth have the service of nine persons each;[80]
but, if eight-tenths are poor, only of four each; if seven-tenths are poor, of two and a third
each; if six-tenths are poor, of one and a half each; and if five-tenths are poor, of only
one each. But, practically, if the rich strive always to obtain more power over the poor, instead
of to raise them--and if, on the other hand, the poor become continually more vicious and numerous,
through neglect and oppression,--though the range of the power of the rich increases, its tenure
becomes less secure; until, at last the measure of iniquity being full, revolution, civil war,
or the subjection of the state to a healthier or stronger one, closes the moral corruption,
and industrial disease.[81]

139. It is rarely, however, that things come to this extremity. Kind persons among the rich,
and wise among the poor, modify the connexion of the classes: the efforts made to raise and
relieve on the one side, and the success of honest toil on the other, bind and blend the orders
of society into the confused tissue of half-felt obligation, sullenly-rendered obedience, and
variously-directed, or mis-directed toil, which form the warp of daily life. But this great
law rules all the wild design: that success (while society is guided by laws of competition)
signifies always so much victory over your neighbour as to obtain the direction of his work,
and to take the profits of it. This is the real source of all great riches. No man can become
largely rich by his personal toil.[82] The work of his own hands, wisely directed, will indeed
always maintain himself and his family, and make fitting provision for his age. But it is only
by the discovery of some method of taxing the labour of others that he can become opulent.
Every increase of his capital enables him to extend this taxation more widely; that is, to
invest larger funds in the maintenance of labourers,--to direct, accordingly, vaster and yet
vaster masses of labour, and to appropriate its profits.

140. There is much confusion of idea on the subject of this appropriation. It is, of course,
the interest of the employer to disguise it from the persons employed; and, for his own comfort
and complacency, he often desires no less to disguise it from himself. And it is matter of
much doubt with me, how far the foul and foolish arguments used habitually on this subject
are indeed the honest expression of foul and foolish convictions;--or rather (as I am sometimes
forced to conclude from the irritation with which they are advanced) are resolutely dishonest,
wilful, and malicious sophisms, arranged so as to mask, to the last moment, the real laws of
economy, and future duties of men. By taking a simple example, and working it thoroughly out,
the subject may be rescued from all but such determined misrepresentation.

141. Let us imagine a society of peasants, living on a rivershore, exposed to destructive inundation
at somewhat extended intervals; and that each peasant possesses of this good, but imperilled,
ground, more than he needs to cultivate for immediate subsistence. We will assume farther (and
with too great probability of justice), that the greater part of them indolently keep in tillage
just as much land as supplies them with daily food;--that they leave their children idle, and
take no precautions against the rise of the stream. But one of them, (we will say but one,
for the sake of greater clearness) cultivates carefully all the ground of his estate; makes
his children work hard and healthily; uses his spare time and theirs in building a rampart
against the river; and, at the end of some years, has in his storehouses large reserves of
food and clothing,--in his stables a well-tended breed of cattle, and around his fields a wedge
of wall against flood.

The torrent rises at last--sweeps away the harvests, and half the cottages of the careless
peasants, and leaves them destitute. They naturally come for help to the provident one, whose
fields are unwasted, and whose granaries are full. He has the right to refuse it to them: no
one disputes this right.[83] But he will probably not refuse it; it is not his interest to
do so, even were he entirely selfish and cruel. The only question with him will be on what
terms his aid is to be granted.

142. Clearly, not on terms of mere charity. To maintain his neighbours in idleness would be
not only his ruin, but theirs. He will require work from them, in exchange for their maintenance;
and, whether in kindness or cruelty, all the work they can give. Not now the three or four
hours they were wont to spend on their own land, but the eight or ten hours they ought to have
spent.[84] But how will he apply this labour? The men are now his slaves;--nothing less, and
nothing more. On pain of starvation, he can force them to work in the manner, and to the end,
he chooses. And it is by his wisdom in this choice that the worthiness of his mastership is
proved, or its unworthiness. Evidently, he must first set them to bank out the water in some
temporary way, and to get their ground cleansed and resown; else, in any case, their continued
maintenance will be impossible. That done, and while he has still to feed them, suppose he
makes them raise a secure rampart for their own ground against all future flood, and rebuild
their houses in safer places, with the best material they can find; being allowed time out
of their working hours to fetch such material from a distance. And for the food and clothing
advanced, he takes security in land that as much shall be returned at a convenient period.

143. We may conceive this security to be redeemed, and the debt paid at the end of a few years.
The prudent peasant has sustained no loss; but is no richer than he was, and has had all his
trouble for nothing. But he has enriched his neighbours materially; bettered their houses,
secured their land, and rendered them, in worldly matters, equal to himself. In all rational
and final sense, he has been throughout their true Lord and King.

144. We will next trace his probable line of conduct, presuming his object to be exclusively
the increase of his own fortune. After roughly recovering and cleansing the ground, he allows
the ruined peasantry only to build huts upon it, such as he thinks protective enough from the
weather to keep them in working health. The rest of their time he occupies, first in pulling
down, and rebuilding on a magnificent scale, his own house, and in adding large dependencies
to it. This done, in exchange for his continued supply of corn, he buys as much of his neighbours'
land as he thinks he can superintend the management of; and makes the former owners securely
embank and protect the ceded portion. By this arrangement, he leaves to a certain number of
the peasantry only as much ground as will just maintain them in their existing numbers; as
the population increases, he takes the extra hands, who cannot be maintained on the narrowed
estates, for his own servants; employs some to cultivate the ground he has bought, giving them
of its produce merely enough for subsistence; with the surplus, which, under his energetic
and careful superintendence, will be large, he maintains a train of servants for state, and
a body of workmen, whom he educates in ornamental arts. He now can splendidly decorate his
house, lay out its grounds magnificently, and richly supply his table, and that of his household
and retinue. And thus, without any abuse of right, we should find established all the phenomena
of poverty and riches, which (it is supposed necessarily) accompany modern civilization. In
one part of the district, we should have unhealthy land, miserable dwellings, and half-starved
poor; in another, a well-ordered estate, well-fed servants, and refined conditions of highly
educated and luxurious life.

145. I have put the two cases in simplicity, and to some extremity. But though in more complex
and qualified operation, all the relations of society are but the expansion of these two typical
sequences of conduct and result. I do not say, observe, that the first procedure is entirely
recommendable; or even entirely right; still less, that the second is wholly wrong. Servants,
and artists, and splendour of habitation and retinue, have all their use, propriety, and office.
But I am determined that the reader shall understand clearly what they cost; and see that the
condition of having them is the subjection to us of a certain number of imprudent or unfortunate
persons (or, it may be, more fortunate than their masters), over whose destinies we exercise
a boundless control. "Riches" mean eternally and essentially this; and God send at last a time
when those words of our best-reputed economist shall be true, and we shall indeed "all know
what it is to be rich;"[85] that it is to be slave-master over farthest earth, and over all
ways and thoughts of men. Every operative you employ is your true servant: distant or near,
subject to your immediate orders, or ministering to your widely-communicated caprice,--for
the pay he stipulates, or the price he tempts,--all are alike under this great dominion of
the gold. The milliner who makes the dress is as much a servant (more so, in that she uses
more intelligence in the service) as the maid who puts it on; the carpenter who smooths the
door, as the footman who opens it; the tradesmen who supply the table, as the labourers and
sailors who supply the tradesmen. Why speak of these lower services? Painters and singers (whether
of note or rhyme,) jesters and storytellers, moralists, historians, priests,--so far as these,
in any degree, paint, or sing, or tell their tale, or charm their charm, or "perform" their
rite, for pay,--in so far, they are all slaves; abject utterly, if the service be for pay only;
abject less and less in proportion to the degrees of love and of wisdom which enter into their
duty, or can enter into it, according as their function is to do the bidding and the work of
a manly people;--or to amuse, tempt, and deceive, a childish one.

146. There is always, in such amusement and temptation, to a certain extent, a government of
the rich by the poor, as of the poor by the rich; but the latter is the prevailing and necessary
one, and it consists, when it is honourable, in the collection of the profits of labour from
those who would have misused them, and the administration of those profits for the service
either of the same persons in future, or of others; and when it is dishonourable, as is more
frequently the case in modern times, it consists in the collection of the profits of labour
from those who would have rightly used them, and their appropriation to the service of the
collector himself.

147. The examination of these various modes of collection and use of riches will form the third
branch of our future inquiries; but the key to the whole subject lies in the clear understanding
of the difference between selfish and unselfish expenditure. It is not easy, by any course
of reasoning, to enforce this on the generally unwilling hearer; yet the definition of unselfish
expenditure is brief and simple. It is expenditure which, if you are a capitalist, does not
pay you, but pays somebody else; and if you are a consumer, does not please you, but pleases
somebody else. Take one special instance, in further illustration of the general type given
above. I did not invent that type, but spoke of a real river, and of real peasantry, the languid
and sickly race which inhabits, or haunts--for they are often more like spectres than living
men--the thorny desolation of the banks of the Arve in Savoy. Some years ago, a society, formed
at Geneva, offered to embank the river for the ground which would have been recovered by the
operation; but the offer was refused by the (then Sardinian) government. The capitalists saw
that this expenditure would have "paid" if the ground saved from the river was to be theirs.
But if, when the offer that had this aspect of profit was refused, they had nevertheless persisted
in the plan, and merely taking security for the return of their outlay, lent the funds for
the work, and thus saved a whole race of human souls from perishing in a pestiferous fen (as,
I presume, some among them would, at personal risk, have dragged any one drowning creature
out of the current of the stream, and not expected payment therefor), such expenditure would
have precisely corresponded to the use of his power made, in the first instance, by our supposed
richer peasant--it would have been the king's, of grace, instead of the usurer's, for gain.

148. "Impossible, absurd, Utopian!" exclaim nine-tenths of the few readers whom these words
may find.

No, good reader, this is not Utopian: but I will tell you what would have seemed, if we had
not seen it, Utopian on the side of evil instead of good; that ever men should have come to
value their money so much more than their lives, that if you call upon them to become soldiers,
and take chance of a bullet through their heart, and of wife and children being left desolate,
for their pride's sake, they will do it gaily, without thinking twice; but if you ask them,
for their country's sake, to spend a hundred pounds without security of getting back a hundred-and-five,[86]
they will laugh in your face.

149. Not but that also this game of life-giving and taking is, in the end, somewhat more costly
than other forms of play might be. Rifle practice is, indeed, a not unhealthy pastime, and
a feather on the top of the head is a pleasing appendage; but while learning the stops and
fingering of the sweet instrument, does no one ever calculate the cost of an overture? What
melody does Tityrus meditate on his tenderly spiral pipe? The leaden seed of it, broadcast,
true conical "Dents de Lion" seed--needing less allowance for the wind than is usual with that
kind of herb--what crop are you likely to have of it? Suppose, instead of this volunteer marching
and countermarching, you were to do a little volunteer ploughing and counter-ploughing? It
is more difficult to do it straight: the dust of the earth, so disturbed, is more grateful
than for merely rhythmic footsteps. Golden cups, also, given for good ploughing, would be more
suitable in colour: (ruby glass, for the wine which "giveth his colour" on the ground, might
be fitter for the rifle prize in ladies' hands). Or, conceive a little volunteer exercise with
the spade, other than such as is needed for moat and breastwork, or even for the burial of
the fruit of the leaden avena-seed, subject to the shrill Lemures' criticism--

    Wer hat das Haus so schlecht gebauet?

If you were to embank Lincolnshire more stoutly against the sea? or strip the peat of Solway,
or plant Plinlimmon moors with larch--then, in due season, some amateur reaping and threshing?

     "Nay, we reap and thresh by steam, in these advanced days."

I know it, my wise and economical friends. The stout arms God gave you to win your bread by,
you would fain shoot your neighbours, and God's sweet singers with;[87] then you invoke the
fiends to your farm-service; and--

    When young and old come forth to play
    On a sulphurous holiday,
    Tell how the darkling goblin sweat
    (His feast of cinders duly set),
    And, belching night, where breathed the morn,
    His shadowy flail hath threshed the corn
    That ten day-labourers could not end.

150. Going back to the matter in hand, we will press the example closer. On a green knoll above
that plain of the Arve, between Cluse and Bonneville, there was, in the year 1860, a cottage,
inhabited by a well-doing family--man and wife, three children, and the grandmother. I call
it a cottage, but in truth, it was a large chimney on the ground, wide at the bottom, so that
the family might live round the fire; lighted by one small broken window, and entered by an
unclosing door. The family, I say, was "well-doing;" at least it was hopeful and cheerful;
the wife healthy, the children, for Savoyards, pretty and active, but the husband threatened
with decline, from exposure under the cliffs of the Mont Vergi by day, and to draughts between
every plank of his chimney in the frosty nights.

"Why could he not plaster the chinks?" asks the practical reader. For the same reason that
your child cannot wash its face and hands till you have washed them many a day for it, and
will not wash them when it can, till you force it.

151. I passed this cottage often in my walks, had its window and door mended; sometimes mended
also a little the meal of sour bread and broth, and generally got kind greeting and smile from
the face of young or old; which greeting this year, narrowed itself into the half-recognizing
stare of the elder child, and the old woman's tears; for the father and mother were both dead,--one
of sickness, the other of sorrow. It happened that I passed not alone, but with a companion,
a practised English joiner, who, while these people were dying of cold, had been employed from
six in the morning to six in the evening, for two months, in fitting, without nails, the panels
of a single door in a large house in London. Three days of his work taken, at the right time
from fastening the oak panels with useless precision, and applied to fasten the larch timbers
with decent strength, would have saved these Savoyards' lives. He would have been maintained
equally; (I suppose him equally paid for his work by the owner of the greater house, only the
work not consumed selfishly on his own walls;) and the two peasants, and eventually, probably
their children, saved.

152. There are, therefore,--let me finally enforce, and leave with the reader, this broad conclusion,--three
things to be considered in employing any poor person. It is not enough to give him employment.
You must employ him first to produce useful things; secondly, of the several (suppose equally
useful) things he can equally well produce, you must set him to make that which will cause
him to lead the healthiest life; lastly, of the things produced, it remains a question of wisdom
and conscience how much you are to take yourself, and how much to leave to others. A large
quantity, remember, unless you destroy it, must always be so left at one time or another; the
only questions you have to decide are, not what you will give, but when, and how, and to whom,
you will give. The natural law of human life is, of course, that in youth a man shall labour
and lay by store for his old age, and when age comes, shall use what he has laid by, gradually
slackening his toil, and allowing himself more frank use of his store; taking care always to
leave himself as much as will surely suffice for him beyond any possible length of life. What
he has gained, or by tranquil and unanxious toil continues to gain, more than is enough for
his own need, he ought so to administer, while he yet lives, as to see the good of it again
beginning, in other hands; for thus he has himself the greatest sum of pleasure from it, and
faithfully uses his sagacity in its control. Whereas most men, it appears, dislike the sight
of their fortunes going out into service again, and say to themselves,--"I can indeed nowise
prevent this money from falling at last into the hands of others, nor hinder the good of it
from becoming theirs, not mine; but at least let a merciful death save me from being a witness
of their satisfaction; and may God so far be gracious to me as to let no good come of any of
this money of mine before my eyes."

153. Supposing this feeling unconquerable, the safest way of rationally indulging it would
be for the capitalist at once to spend all his fortune on himself, which might actually, in
many cases, be quite the rightest as well as the pleasantest thing to do, if he had just tastes
and worthy passions. But, whether for himself only, or through the hands, and for the sake,
of others also, the law of wise life is, that the maker of the money shall also be the spender
of it, and spend it, approximately, all, before he dies; so that his true ambition as an economist
should be, to die, not as rich, but as poor, as possible,[88] calculating the ebb tide of possession
in true and calm proportion to the ebb tide of life. Which law, checking the wing of accumulative
desire in the mid-volley,[89] and leading to peace of possession and fulness of fruition in
old age, is also wholesome, in that by the freedom of gift, together with present help and
counsel, it at once endears and dignifies age in the sight of youth, which then no longer strips
the bodies of the dead, but receives the grace of the living. Its chief use would (or will
be, for men are indeed capable of attaining to this much use of their reason), that some temperance
and measure will be put to the acquisitiveness of commerce.[90] For as things stand, a man
holds it his duty to be temperate in his food, and of his body, but for no duty to be temperate
in his riches, and of his mind. He sees that he ought not to waste his youth and his flesh
for luxury; but he will waste his age, and his soul, for money, and think he does no wrong,
nor know the delirium tremens of the intellect for disease. But the law of life is, that a
man should fix the sum he desires to make annually, as the food he desires to eat daily; and
stay when he has reached the limit, refusing increase of business, and leaving it to others,
so obtaining due freedom of time for better thoughts.[91] How the gluttony of business is punished,
a bill of health for the principals of the richest city houses, issued annually, would show
in a sufficiently impressive manner.

154. I know, of course, that these statements will be received by the modern merchant as an
active border rider of the sixteenth century would have heard of its being proper for men of
the Marches to get their living by the spade, instead of the spur. But my business is only
to state veracities and necessities; I neither look for the acceptance of the one, nor hope
for the nearness of the other. Near or distant, the day will assuredly come when the merchants
of a state shall be its true ministers of exchange, its porters, in the double sense of carriers
and gate-keepers, bringing all lands into frank and faithful communication, and knowing for
their master of guild, Hermes the herald, instead of Mercury the gain-guarder.

155. And now, finally, for immediate rule to all who will accept it.

The distress of any population means that they need food, house-room, clothes, and fuel. You
can never, therefore, be wrong in employing any labourer to produce food, house-room, clothes,
or fuel; but you are always wrong if you employ him to produce nothing, (for then some other
labourer must be worked double time to feed him); and you are generally wrong, at present,
if you employ him (unless he can do nothing else) to produce works of art or luxuries; because
modern art is mostly on a false basis, and modern luxury is criminally great.[92]

156. The way to produce more food is mainly to bring in fresh ground, and increase facilities
of carriage;--to break rock, exchange earth, drain the moist, and water the dry, to mend roads,
and build harbours of refuge. Taxation thus spent will annihilate taxation, but spent in war,
it annihilates revenue.

157. The way to produce house-room is to apply your force first to the humblest dwellings.
When your brick-layers are out of employ, do not build splendid new streets, but better the
old ones; send your paviours and slaters to the poorest villages, and see that your poor are
healthily lodged, before you try your hand on stately architecture. You will find its stateliness
rise better under the trowel afterwards; and we do do not yet build so well that we need hasten
to display our skill to future ages. Had the labour which has decorated the Houses of Parliament
filled, instead, rents in walls and roofs throughout the county of Middlesex; and our deputies
met to talk within massive walls that would have needed no stucco for five hundred years,--the
decoration might have been afterwards, and the talk now. And touching even our highly conscientious
church building, it may be well to remember that in the best days of church plans, their masons
called themselves "logeurs du bon Dieu;" and that since, according to the most trusted reports,
God spends a good deal of His time in cottages as well as in churches, He might perhaps like
to be a little better lodged there also.

158. The way to get more clothes is--not, necessarily, to get more cotton. There were words
written twenty years ago[93] which would have saved many of us some shivering, had they been
minded in time. Shall we read them again?

"The Continental people, it would seem, are importing our machinery, beginning to spin cotton,
and manufacture for themselves; to cut us out of this market, and then out of that! Sad news,
indeed; but irremediable. By no means the saddest news--the saddest news, is that we should
find our national existence, as I sometimes hear it said, depend on selling manufactured cotton
at a farthing an ell cheaper than any other people. A most narrow stand for a great nation
to base itself on! A stand which, with all the Corn-law abrogations conceivable, I do not think
will be capable of enduring.

"My friends, suppose we quitted that stand; suppose we came honestly down from it and said--'This
is our minimum of cotton prices; we care not, for the present, to make cotton any cheaper.
Do you, if it seem so blessed to you, make cotton cheaper. Fill your lungs with cotton fur,
your heart with copperas fumes, with rage and mutiny; become ye the general gnomes of Europe,
slaves of the lamp!' I admire a nation which fancies it will die if it do not undersell all
other nations to the end of the world. Brothers, we will cease to undersell them; we will be
content to equal-sell them; to be happy selling equally with them! I do not see the use of
underselling them: cotton-cloth is already twopence a yard, or lower; and yet bare backs were
never more numerous among us. Let inventive men cease to spend their existence incessantly
contriving how cotton can be made cheaper; and try to invent a little how cotton at its present
cheapness could be somewhat justlier divided among us.

"Let inventive men consider--whether the secret of this universe does after all consist in
making money. With a hell which means--'failing to make money,' I do not think there is any
heaven possible that would suit one well. In brief, all this Mammon gospel of supply-and-demand,
competition laissez faire, and devil take the hindmost (foremost, is it not, rather, Mr. Carlyle?),
'begins to be one of the shabbiest gospels ever preached.'"

159. The way to produce more fuel[94] is first to make your coal mines safer, by sinking more
shafts; then set all your convicts to work in them, and if, as is to be hoped, you succeed
in diminishing the supply of that sort of labourer, consider what means there may be, first,
of growing forest where its growth will improve climate; secondly, of splintering the forests
which now make continents of fruitful land pathless and poisonous, into fagots for fire;--so
gaining at once dominion icewards and sunwards. Your steam power has been given (you will find
eventually) for work such as that: and not for excursion trains, to give the labourer a moment's
breath, at the peril of his breath for ever, from amidst the cities which it has crushed into
masses of corruption. When you know how to build cities, and how to rule them, you will be
able to breathe in their streets, and the "excursion" will be the afternoon's walk or game
in the fields round them.

160. "But nothing of this work will pay?"

No; no more than it pays to dust your rooms, or wash your doorsteps. It will pay; not at first
in currency, but in that which is the end and the source of currency,--in life; (and in currency
richly afterwards). It will pay in that which is more than life,--in light, whose true price
has not yet been reckoned in any currency, and yet into the image of which, all wealth, one
way or other, must be cast. For your riches must either be as the lightning, which,

                Begot but in a cloud,
    Though shining bright, and speaking loud,
    Whilst it begins, concludes its violent race;
    And, where it gilds, it wounds the place;--

or else, as the lightning of the sacred sign, which shines from one part of the heaven to the
other. There is no other choice; you must either take dust for deity, spectre for possession,
fettered dream for life, and for epitaph, this reversed verse of the great Hebrew hymn of economy
(Psalm cxii.):--"He hath gathered together, he hath stripped the poor, his iniquity remaineth
for ever:"--or else, having the sun of justice to shine on you, and the sincere substance of
good in your possession, and the pure law and liberty of life within you, leave men to write
this better legend over your grave:--

"He hath dispersed abroad. He hath given to the poor. His righteousness remaineth for ever."

FOOTNOTES:

[78] In the present general examination, I concede so much to ordinary economists as to ignore
all innocent poverty. I adapt my reasoning, for once, to the modern English practical mind,
by assuming poverty to be always criminal; the conceivable exceptions we will examine afterwards.

[79] [I have no terms of English, and can find none in Greek nor Latin, nor in any other strong
language known to me, contemptuous enough to attach to the bestial idiotism of the modern theory
that wages are to be measured by competition.]

[80] I say nothing yet of the quality of the servants, which, nevertheless, is the gist of
the business. Will you have Paul Veronese to paint your ceiling, or the plumber from over the
way? Both will work for the same money; Paul, if anything, a little the cheaper of the two,
if you keep him in good humour; only you have to discern him first, which will need eyes.

[81] [I have not altered a syllable in these three paragraphs, 137, 138, 139, on revision;
but have much italicised: the principles stated being as vital, as they are little known.]

[82] By his art he may; but only when its produce, or the sight or hearing of it, becomes a
subject of dispute, so as to enable the artist to tax the labour of multitudes highly, in exchange
for his own.

[83] [Observe this; the legal right to keep what you have worked for, and use it as you please,
is the corner-stone of all economy: compare the end of Chap. II.]

[84] [I should now put the time of necessary labour rather under than over the third of the day.]

[85] [See Preface to Unto this Last.]

[86] I have not hitherto touched on the subject of interest of money; it is too complex, and
must be reserved for its proper place in the body of the work. The definition of interest (apart
from compensation for risk) is, "the exponent of the comfort of accomplished labour, separated
from its power;" the power being what is lent: and the French economists who have maintained
the entire illegality of interest are wrong; yet by no means so curiously or wildly wrong as
the English and French ones opposed to them, whose opinions have been collected by Dr. Whewell
at page 41 of his Lectures; it never seeming to occur to the mind of the compiler, any more
than to the writers whom he quotes, that it is quite possible, and even (according to Jewish
proverb) prudent, for men to hoard as ants and mice do, for use, not usury; and lay by something
for winter nights, in the expectation of rather sharing than lending the scrapings. My Savoyard
squirrels would pass a pleasant time of it under the snow-laden pine branches, if they always
declined to economize because no one would pay them interest on nuts.

[I leave this note as it stood: but, as I have above stated, should now side wholly with the
French economists spoken of, in asserting the absolute illegality of interest.]

[87] Compare Chaucer's feeling respecting birds (from Canace's falcon, to the nightingale,
singing, "Domine, labia--" to the Lord of Love), with the usual modern British sentiments on
this subject. Or even Cowley's:--

    "What prince's choir of music can excel
    That which within this shade does dwell,
    To which we nothing pay, or give,
    They, like all other poets, live
    Without reward, or thanks for their obliging pains!
    'Tis well if they become not prey."

Yes; it Is better than well; particularly since the seed sown by the wayside has been protected
by the peculiar appropriation of part of the church-rates in our country parishes. See the
remonstrance from a "Country parson," in The Times of June 4th (or 5th; the letter is dated
June 3rd,) 1862:--"I have heard at a vestry meeting a good deal of higgling over a few shillings'
outlay in cleaning the church; but I have never heard any dissatisfaction expressed on account
of that part of the rate which is invested in 50 or 100 dozens of birds' heads."

[If we could trace the innermost of all causes of modern war, I believe it would be found,
not in the avarice nor ambition of nations, but in the mere idleness of the upper classes.
They have nothing to do but to teach the peasantry to kill each other.]

[88] [See the Life of Fenelon. "The labouring peasantry were at all times the objects of his
tenderest care; his palace at Cambray, with all his books and writings, being consumed by fire,
he bore the misfortune with unruffled calmness, and said it was better his palace should be
burnt than the cottage of a poor peasant." (These thoroughly good men always go too far, and
lose their power over the mass.) He died exemplifying the mean he had always observed between
prodigality and avarice, leaving neither debts nor money.]

[89] [Greek: kai penian hêgoumenous einai mê to tên ousian elattô poiein alla to têi aplêstian
pleiô]. "And thinking (wisely) that poverty consists not in making one's possessions less,
but one's avarice more."--Laws, v. 8. Read the context, and compare. "He who spends for all
that is noble, and gains by nothing but what is just, will hardly be notably wealthy, or distressfully
poor."--Laws, v. 42.

[90] The fury of modern trade arises chiefly out of the possibility of making sudden fortunes
by largeness of transaction, and accident of discovery or contrivance. I have no doubt that
the final interest of every nation is to check the action of these commercial lotteries; and
that all great accidental gains or losses should be national,--not individual. But speculation
absolute, unconnected with commercial effort, is an unmitigated evil in a state, and the root
of countless evils beside.

[91] [I desire in the strongest terms to reinforce all that is contained in this paragraph.]

[92] It is especially necessary that the reader should keep his mind fixed on the methods of
consumption and destruction, as the true sources of national poverty. Men are apt to call every
exchange "expenditure," but it is only consumption which is expenditure. A large number of
the purchases made by the richer classes are mere forms of interchange of unused property,
wholly without effect on national prosperity. It matters nothing to the state whether, if a
china pipkin be rated as worth a hundred pounds, A has the pipkin and B the pounds, or A the
pounds and B the pipkin. But if the pipkin is pretty, and A or B breaks it, there is national
loss, not otherwise. So again, when the loss has really taken place, no shifting of the shoulders
that bear it will do away with the reality of it. There is an intensely ludicrous notion in
the public mind respecting the abolishment of debt by denying it. When a debt is denied, the
lender loses instead of the borrower, that is all; the loss is precisely, accurately, everlastingly
the same. The Americans borrow money to spend in blowing up their own houses. They deny their
debt, by one-third already [1863], gold being at fifty premium; and they will probably deny
it wholly. That merely means that the holders of the notes are to be the losers instead of
the issuers. The quantity of loss is precisely equal, and irrevocable; it is the quantity of
human industry spent in effecting the explosion, plus the quantity of goods exploded. Honour
only decides who shall pay the sum lost not whether it is to be paid or not. Paid it must be,
and to the uttermost farthing.

[93] [(Past and Present. Chap. IX. of Third Section.) To think that for these twenty--now twenty-six--years,
this one voice of Carlyle's has been the only faithful and useful utterance in all England,
and has sounded through all these years in vain! See Fors Clavigera, Letter X.]

[94] [We don't want to produce more fuel just now, but much less; and to use what we get for
cooking and warming ourselves, instead of for running from place to place.]

APPENDICES.

I have brought together in these last pages a few notes, which were not properly to be incorporated
with the text, and which, at the bottom of pages, checked the reader's attention to the main
argument. They contain, however, several statements to which I wish to be able to refer, or
have already referred, in other of my books, so that I think right to preserve them.

APPENDIX I.--(p. 22.)

The greatest of all economists are those most opposed to the doctrine of "laissez faire," namely,
the fortifying virtues, which the wisest men of all time have arranged under the general heads
of Prudence, or Discretion (the spirit which discerns and adopts rightly); Justice (the spirit
which rules and divides rightly); Fortitude (the spirit which persists and endures rightly);
and Temperance (the spirit which stops and refuses rightly). These cardinal and sentinel virtues
are not only the means of protecting and prolonging life itself, but they are the chief guards,
or sources, of the material means of life, and the governing powers and princes of economy.
Thus, precisely according to the number of just men in a nation, is their power of avoiding
either intestine or foreign war. All disputes may be peaceably settled, if a sufficient number
of persons have been trained to submit to the principles of justice, while the necessity for
war is in direct ratio to the number of unjust persons who are incapable of determining a quarrel
but by violence. Whether the injustice take the form of the desire of dominion, or of refusal
to submit to it, or of lust of territory, or lust of money, or of mere irregular passion and
wanton will, the result is economically the same;--loss of the quantity of power and life consumed
in repressing the injustice, added to the material and moral destruction caused by the fact
of war. The early civil wars of England, and the existing[95] war in America, are curious examples--these
under monarchical, this under republican, institutions--of the results on large masses of nations
of the want of education in principles of justice. But the mere dread or distrust resulting
from the want of the inner virtues of Faith and Charity prove often no less costly than war
itself. The fear which France and England have of each other costs each nation about fifteen
millions sterling annually, besides various paralyses of commerce; that sum being spent in
the manufacture of means of destruction instead of means of production. There is no more reason
in the nature of things that France and England should be hostile to each other than that England
and Scotland should be, or Lancashire and Yorkshire; and the reciprocal terrors of the opposite
sides of the English Channel are neither more necessary, more economical, nor more virtuous,
than the old riding and reiving on the opposite flanks of the Cheviots, or than England's own
weaving for herself of crowns of thorn, from the stems of her Red and White roses.

APPENDIX II.--(p. 34.)

Few passages of the book which at least some part of the nations at present most advanced in
civilization accept as an expression of final truth, have been more distorted than those bearing
on Idolatry. For the idolatry there denounced is neither sculpture, nor veneration of sculpture.
It is simply the substitution of an "Eidolon," phantasm, or imagination of Good, for that which
is real and enduring; from the Highest Living Good, which gives life, to the lowest material
good which ministers to it. The Creator, and the things created, which He is said to have "seen
good" in creating, are in this their eternal goodness appointed always to be "worshipped,"--i.
e., to have goodness and worth ascribed to them from the heart; and the sweep and range of
idolatry extend to the rejection of any or all of these, "calling evil good, and good evil,--putting
bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter."[96] For in that rejection and substitution we betray
the first of all Loyalties, to the fixed Law of life, and with resolute opposite loyalty serve
our own imagination of good, which is the law, not of the House, but of the Grave, (otherwise
called the law of "mark missing," which we translate "law of Sin"); these "two masters," between
whose services we have to choose, being otherwise distinguished as God and Mammon, which Mammon,
though we narrowly take it as the power of money only, is in truth the great evil Spirit of
false and fond desire, or "Covetousness, which is Idolatry." So that Iconoclasm--image-breaking--is
easy; but an Idol cannot be broken--it must be forsaken; and this is not so easy, either to
do, or persuade to doing. For men may readily be convinced of the weakness of an image; but
not of the emptiness of an imagination.

APPENDIX III.--(p. 36.)

I have not attempted to support, by the authority of other writers, any of the statements made
in these papers; indeed, if such authorities were rightly collected, there would be no occasion
for my writing at all. Even in the scattered passages referring to this subject in three books
of Carlyle's--Sartor Resartus, Past and Present, and the Latter Day Pamphlets,--all has been
said that needs to be said, and far better than I shall ever say it again. But the habit of
the public mind at present is to require everything to be uttered diffusely, loudly, and a
hundred times over, before it will listen; and it has revolted against these papers of mine
as if they contained things daring and new, when there is not one assertion in them of which
the truth has not been for ages known to the wisest, and proclaimed by the most eloquent of
men. It would be [I had written will be; but have now reached a time of life for which there
is but one mood--the conditional,] a far greater pleasure to me hereafter, to collect their
words than to add to mine; Horace's clear rendering of the substance of the passages in the
text may be found room for at once,

    Si quis emat citharas, emptas comportet in unum
    Nec studio citharae, nec Musae deditus ulli;
    Si scalpra et formas non sutor, nautica vela
    Aversus mercaturis, delirus et amens
    Undique dicatur merito. Qui discrepat istis
    Qui nummos aurumque recondit, nescius uti
    Compositis; metuensque velut contingere sacrum?

[Which may be roughly thus translated:--

     "Were anybody to buy fiddles, and collect a number, being in
     no wise given to fiddling, nor fond of music: or if, being
     no cobbler, he collected awls and lasts, or, having no mind
     for sea-adventure, bought sails, every one would call him a
     madman, and deservedly. But what difference is there between
     such a man and one who lays by coins and gold, and does not
     know how to use, when he has got them?"]

With which it is perhaps desirable also to give Xenophon's statement, it being clearer than
any English one can be, owing to the power of the general Greek term for wealth, "useable things."

[I have cut out the Greek because I can't be troubled to correct the accents, and am always
nervous about them; here it is in English, as well as I can do it:--

"This being so, it follows that things are only property to the man who knows how to use them;
as flutes, for instance, are property to the man who can pipe upon them respectably; but to
one who knows not how to pipe, they are no property, unless he can get rid of them advantageously....
For if they are not sold, the flutes are no property (being serviceable for nothing); but,
sold, they become property. To which Socrates made answer,--'and only then if he knows how
to sell them, for if he sell them to another man who cannot play on them, still they are no
property.'"]

APPENDIX IV.--(p. 39.)

The reader is to include here in the idea of "Government," any branch of the Executive, or
even any body of private persons, entrusted with the practical management of public interests
unconnected directly with their own personal ones. In theoretical discussions of legislative
interference with political economy, it is usually, and of course unnecessarily, assumed that
Government must be always of that form and force in which we have been accustomed to see it;--that
its abuses can never be less, nor its wisdom greater, nor its powers more numerous. But, practically,
the custom in most civilized countries is, for every man to deprecate the interference of Government
as long as things tell for his personal advantage, and to call for it when they cease to do
so. The request of the Manchester Economists to be supplied with cotton by Government (the
system of supply and demand having, for the time, fallen sorrowfully short of the expectations
of scientific persons from it), is an interesting case in point. It were to be wished that
less wide and bitter suffering, suffering, too, of the innocent, had been needed to force the
nation, or some part of it, to ask itself why a body of men, already confessedly capable of
managing matters both military and divine, should not be permitted, or even requested, at need,
to provide in some wise for sustenance as well as for defence; and secure, if it might be,--(and
it might, I think, even the rather be),--purity of bodily, as well as of spiritual, aliment?
Why, having made many roads for the passage of armies, may they not make a few for the conveyance
of food; and after organizing, with applause, various schemes of theological instruction for
the Public, organize, moreover, some methods of bodily nourishment for them? Or is the soul
so much less trustworthy in its instincts than the stomach, that legislation is necessary for
the one, but inapplicable to the other.

APPENDIX V.--(p. 70.)

I debated with myself whether to make the note on Homer longer by examining the typical meaning
of the shipwreck of Ulysses, and his escape from Charybdis by help of her fig-tree; but as
I should have had to go on to the lovely myth of Leucothea's veil, and did not care to spoil
this by a hurried account of it, I left it for future examination; and, three days after the
paper was published, observed that the reviewers, with their customary helpfulness, were endeavouring
to throw the whole subject back into confusion by dwelling on this single (as they imagined)
oversight. I omitted also a note on the sense of the word [Greek: lygron], with respect to
the pharmacy of Circe, and herb-fields of Helen, (compare its use in Odyssey, xvii., 473, &c.),
which would farther have illustrated the nature of the Circean power. But, not to be led too
far into the subtleties of these myths, observe respecting them all, that even in very simple
parables, it is not always easy to attach indisputable meaning to every part of them. I recollect
some years ago, throwing an assembly of learned persons who had met to delight themselves with
interpretations of the parable of the prodigal son, (interpretations which had up to that moment
gone very smoothly,) into mute indignation, by inadvertently asking who the unprodigal son
was, and what was to be learned by his example. The leading divine of the company, Mr. Molyneux,
at last explained to me that the unprodigal son was a lay figure, put in for dramatic effect,
to make the story prettier, and that no note was to be taken of him. Without, however, admitting
that Homer put in the last escape of Ulysses merely to make his story prettier, this is nevertheless
true of all Greek myths, that they have many opposite lights and shades; they are as changeful
as opal, and like opal, usually have one colour by reflected, and another by transmitted light.
But they are true jewels for all that, and full of noble enchantment for those who can use
them; for those who cannot, I am content to repeat the words I wrote four years ago, in the
appendix to the Two Paths--

"The entire purpose of a great thinker may be difficult to fathom, and we may be over and over
again more or less mistaken in guessing at his meaning; but the real, profound, nay, quite
bottomless and unredeemable mistake, is the fool's thought, that he had no meaning."

APPENDIX VI.--(p. 84)

The derivation of words is like that of rivers: there is one real source, usually small, unlikely,
and difficult to find, far up among the hills; then, as the word flows on and comes into service,
it takes in the force of other words from other sources, and becomes quite another word--often
much more than one word, after the junction--a word as it were of many waters, sometimes both
sweet and bitter. Thus the whole force of our English "charity" depends on the guttural in
"charis" getting confused with the c of the Latin "carus;" thenceforward throughout the middle
ages, the two ideas ran on together, and both got confused with St. Paul's [Greek: agapê],
which expresses a different idea in all sorts of ways; our "charity" having not only brought
in the entirely foreign sense of alms-giving, but lost the essential sense of contentment,
and lost much more in getting too far away from the "charis" of the final Gospel benedictions.
For truly it is fine Christianity we have come to, which, professing to expect the perpetual
grace or charity of its Founder, has not itself grace or charity enough to hinder it from overreaching
its friends in sixpenny bargains; and which, supplicating evening and morning the forgiveness
of its own debts, goes forth at noon to take its fellow-servants by the throat, saying,--not
merely "Pay me that thou owest," but "Pay me that thou owest me not."

It is true that we sometimes wear Ophelia's rue with a difference, and call it "Herb o' grace
o' Sundays," taking consolation out of the offertory with--"Look, what he layeth out; it shall
be paid him again." Comfortable words indeed, and good to set against the old royalty of Largesse--

    Whose moste joie was, I wis,
    When that she gave, and said, "Have this."

[I am glad to end, for this time, with these lovely words of Chaucer. We have heard only too
much lately of "Indiscriminate charity," with implied reproval, not of the Indiscrimination
merely, but of the Charity also. We have partly succeeded in enforcing on the minds of the
poor the idea that it is disgraceful to receive; and are likely, without much difficulty, to
succeed in persuading not a few of the rich that it is disgraceful to give. But the political
economy of a great state makes both giving and receiving graceful; and the political economy
of true religion interprets the saying that "it is more blessed to give than to receive," not
as the promise of reward in another life for mortified selfishness in this, but as pledge of
bestowal upon us of that sweet and better nature, which does not mortify itself in giving.]

PREFACE.

Eight years ago, in the close of the first volume of "Modern Painters," I ventured to give
the following advice to the young artists of England:--

"They should go to nature in all singleness of heart, and walk with her laboriously and trustingly,
having no other thought but how best to penetrate her meaning; rejecting nothing, selecting
nothing, and scorning nothing." Advice which, whether bad or good, involved infinite labor
and humiliation in the following it; and was therefore, for the most part, rejected.

It has, however, at last been carried out, to the very letter, by a group of men who, for their
reward, have been assailed with the most scurrilous abuse which I ever recollect seeing issue
from the public press. I have, therefore, thought it due to them to contradict the directly
false statements which have been made respecting their works; and to point out the kind of
merit which, however deficient in some respects, those works possess beyond the possibility
of dispute.

    Denmark Hill,

    Aug. 1851.

PRE-RAPHAELITISM.

It may be proved, with much certainty, that God intends no man to live in this world without
working: but it seems to me no less evident that He intends every man to be happy in his work.
It is written, "in the sweat of thy brow," but it was never written, "in the breaking of thine
heart," thou shalt eat bread; and I find that, as on the one hand, infinite misery is caused
by idle people, who both fail in doing what was appointed for them to do, and set in motion
various springs of mischief in matters in which they should have had no concern, so on the
other hand, no small misery is caused by over-worked and unhappy people, in the dark views
which they necessarily take up themselves, and force upon others, of work itself. Were it not
so, I believe the fact of their being unhappy is in itself a violation of divine law, and a
sign of some kind of folly or sin in their way of life. Now in order that people may be happy
in their work, these three things are needed: They must be fit for it: They must not do too
much of it: and they must have a sense of success in it--not a doubtful sense, such as needs
some testimony of other people for its confirmation, but a sure sense, or rather knowledge,
that so much work has been done well, and fruitfully done, whatever the world may say or think
about it. So that in order that a man may be happy, it is necessary that he should not only
be capable of his work, but a good judge of his work.

The first thing then that he has to do, if unhappily his parents or masters have not done it
for him, is to find out what he is fit for. In which inquiry a man may be very safely guided
by his likings, if he be not also guided by his pride. People usually reason in some such fashion
as this: "I don't seem quite fit for a head-manager in the firm of ---- & Co., therefore, in
all probability, I am fit to be Chancellor of the Exchequer." Whereas, they ought rather to
reason thus: "I don't seem quite fit to be head-manager in the firm of ---- & Co., but I daresay
I might do something in a small green-grocery business; I used to be a good judge of peas;"
that is to say, always trying lower instead of trying higher, until they find bottom: once
well set on the ground, a man may build up by degrees, safely, instead of disturbing every
one in his neighborhood by perpetual catastrophes. But this kind of humility is rendered especially
difficult in these days, by the contumely thrown on men in humble employments. The very removal
of the massy bars which once separated one class of society from another, has rendered it tenfold
more shameful in foolish people's, i. e. in most people's eyes, to remain in the lower grades
of it, than ever it was before. When a man born of an artisan was looked upon as an entirely
different species of animal from a man born of a noble, it made him no more uncomfortable or
ashamed to remain that different species of animal, than it makes a horse ashamed to remain
a horse, and not to become a giraffe. But now that a man may make money, and rise in the world,
and associate himself, unreproached, with people once far above him, not only is the natural
discontentedness of humanity developed to an unheard-of extent, whatever a man's position,
but it becomes a veritable shame to him to remain in the state he was born in, and everybody
thinks it his duty to try to be a "gentleman." Persons who have any influence in the management
of public institutions for charitable education know how common this feeling has become. Hardly
a day passes but they receive letters from mothers who want all their six or eight sons to
go to college, and make the grand tour in the long vacation, and who think there is something
wrong in the foundations of society, because this is not possible. Out of every ten letters
of this kind, nine will allege, as the reason of the writers' importunity, their desire to
keep their families in such and such a "station of life." There is no real desire for the safety,
the discipline, or the moral good of the children, only a panic horror of the inexpressibly
pitiable calamity of their living a ledge or two lower on the molehill of the world--a calamity
to be averted at any cost whatever, of struggle, anxiety, and shortening of life itself. I
do not believe that any greater good could be achieved for the country, than the change in
public feeling on this head, which might be brought about by a few benevolent men, undeniably
in the class of "gentlemen," who would, on principle, enter into some of our commonest trades,
and make them honorable; showing that it was possible for a man to retain his dignity, and
remain, in the best sense, a gentleman, though part of his time was every day occupied in manual
labor, or even in serving customers over a counter. I do not in the least see why courtesy,
and gravity, and sympathy with the feelings of others, and courage, and truth, and piety, and
what else goes to make up a gentleman's character, should not be found behind a counter as
well as elsewhere, if they were demanded, or even hoped for, there.

Let us suppose, then, that the man's way of life and manner of work have been discreetly chosen;
then the next thing to be required is, that he do not over-work himself therein. I am not going
to say anything here about the various errors in our systems of society and commerce, which
appear (I am not sure if they ever do more than appear) to force us to over-work ourselves
merely that we may live; nor about the still more fruitful cause of unhealthy toil--the incapability,
in many men, of being content with the little that is indeed necessary to their happiness.
I have only a word or two to say about one special cause of over-work--the ambitious desire
of doing great or clever things, and the hope of accomplishing them by immense efforts: hope
as vain as it is pernicious; not only making men over-work themselves, but rendering all the
work they do unwholesome to them. I say it is a vain hope, and let the reader be assured of
this (it is a truth all-important to the best interests of humanity). No great intellectual
thing was ever done by great effort; a great thing can only be done by a great man, and he
does it without effort. Nothing is, at present, less understood by us than this--nothing is
more necessary to be understood. Let me try to say it as clearly, and explain it as fully as I may.

I have said no great intellectual thing: for I do not mean the assertion to extend to things
moral. On the contrary, it seems to me that just because we are intended, as long as we live,
to be in a state of intense moral effort, we are not intended to be in intense physical or
intellectual effort. Our full energies are to be given to the soul's work--to the great fight
with the Dragon--the taking the kingdom of heaven by force. But the body's work and head's
work are to be done quietly, and comparatively without effort. Neither limbs nor brain are
ever to be strained to their utmost; that is not the way in which the greatest quantity of
work is to be got out of them: they are never to be worked furiously, but with tranquillity
and constancy. We are to follow the plough from sunrise to sunset, but not to pull in race-boats
at the twilight: we shall get no fruit of that kind of work, only disease of the heart.

How many pangs would be spared to thousands, if this great truth and law were but once sincerely,
humbly understood,--that if a great thing can be done at all, it can be done easily; that,
when it is needed to be done, there is perhaps only one man in the world who can do it; but
he can do it without any trouble--without more trouble, that is, than it costs small people
to do small things; nay, perhaps, with less. And yet what truth lies more openly on the surface
of all human phenomena? Is not the evidence of Ease on the very front of all the greatest works
in existence? Do they not say plainly to us, not, "there has been a great effort here," but,
"there has been a great power here"? It is not the weariness of mortality, but the strength
of divinity, which we have to recognise in all mighty things; and that is just what we now
never recognise, but think that we are to do great things, by help of iron bars and perspiration:--alas!
we shall do nothing that way but lose some pounds of our own weight.

Yet, let me not be misunderstood, nor this great truth be supposed anywise resolvable into
the favorite dogma of young men, that they need not work if they have genius. The fact is,
that a man of genius is always far more ready to work than other people, and gets so much more
good from the work that he does, and is often so little conscious of the inherent divinity
in himself, that he is very apt to ascribe all his capacity to his work, and to tell those
who ask how he came to be what he is: "If I am anything, which I much doubt, I made myself
so merely by labor." This was Newton's way of talking, and I suppose it would be the general
tone of men whose genius had been devoted to the physical sciences. Genius in the Arts must
commonly be more self-conscious, but in whatever field, it will always be distinguished by
its perpetual, steady, well-directed, happy, and faithful labor in accumulating and disciplining
its powers, as well as by its gigantic, incommunicable facility in exercising them. Therefore,
literally, it is no man's business whether he has genius or not: work he must, whatever he
is, but quietly and steadily; and the natural and unforced results of such work will be always
the things that God meant him to do, and will be his best. No agonies nor heart-rendings will
enable him to do any better. If he be a great man, they will be great things; if a small man,
small things; but always, if thus peacefully done, good and right; always, if restlessly and
ambitiously done, false, hollow, and despicable.

Then the third thing needed was, I said, that a man should be a good judge of his work; and
this chiefly that he may not be dependent upon popular opinion for the manner of doing it,
but also that he may have the just encouragement of the sense of progress, and an honest consciousness
of victory: how else can he become

    "That awful independent on to-morrow,
    Whose yesterdays look backwards with a smile."

I am persuaded that the real nourishment and help of such a feeling as this is nearly unknown
to half the workmen of the present day. For whatever appearance of self-complacency there may
be in their outward bearing, it is visible enough, by their feverish jealousy of each other,
how little confidence they have in the sterling value of their several doings. Conceit may
puff a man up, but never prop him up; and there is too visible distress and hopelessness in
men's aspects to admit of the supposition that they have any stable support of faith in themselves.

I have stated these principles generally, because there is no branch of labor to which they
do not apply: But there is one in which our ignorance or forgetfulness of them has caused an
incalculable amount of suffering: and I would endeavor now to reconsider them with especial
reference to it,--the branch of the Arts.

In general, the men who are employed in the Arts have freely chosen their profession, and suppose
themselves to have special faculty for it; yet, as a body, they are not happy men. For which
this seems to me the reason, that they are expected, and themselves expect, to make their bread
by being clever--not by steady or quiet work; and are, therefore, for the most part, trying
to be clever, and so living in an utterly false state of mind and action.

This is the case, to the same extent, in no other profession or employment. A lawyer may indeed
suspect that, unless he has more wit than those around him, he is not likely to advance in
his profession; but he will not be always thinking how he is to display his wit. He will generally
understand, early in his career, that wit must be left to take care of itself, and that it
is hard knowledge of law and vigorous examination and collation of the facts of every case
entrusted to him, which his clients will mainly demand; this it is which he has to be paid
for; and this is healthy and measurable labor, payable by the hour. If he happen to have keen
natural perception and quick wit, these will come into play in their due time and place, but
he will not think of them as his chief power; and if he have them not, he may still hope that
industry and conscientiousness may enable him to rise in his profession without them. Again
in the case of clergymen: that they are sorely tempted to display their eloquence or wit, none
who know their own hearts will deny, but then they know this to be a temptation: they never
would suppose that cleverness was all that was to be expected from them, or would sit down
deliberately to write a clever sermon: even the dullest or vainest of them would throw some
veil over their vanity, and pretend to some profitableness of purpose in what they did. They
would not openly ask of their hearers--Did you think my sermon ingenious, or my language poetical?
They would early understand that they were not paid for being ingenious, nor called to be so,
but to preach truth; that if they happened to possess wit, eloquence, or originality, these
would appear and be of service in due time, but were not to be continually sought after or
exhibited: and if it should happen that they had them not, they might still be serviceable
pastors without them.

Not so with the unhappy artist. No one expects any honest or useful work of him; but every
one expects him to be ingenious. Originality, dexterity, invention, imagination, every thing
is asked of him except what alone is to be had for asking--honesty and sound work, and the
due discharge of his function as a painter. What function? asks the reader in some surprise.
He may well ask; for I suppose few painters have any idea what their function is, or even that
they have any at all.

And yet surely it is not so difficult to discover. The faculties, which when a man finds in
himself, he resolves to be a painter, are, I suppose, intenseness of observation and facility
of imitation. The man is created an observer and an imitator; and his function is to convey
knowledge to his fellow-men, of such things as cannot be taught otherwise than ocularly. For
a long time this function remained a religious one: it was to impress upon the popular mind
the reality of the objects of faith, and the truth of the histories of Scripture, by giving
visible form to both. That function has now passed away, and none has as yet taken its place.
The painter has no profession, no purpose. He is an idler on the earth, chasing the shadows
of his own fancies.

But he was never meant to be this. The sudden and universal Naturalism, or inclination to copy
ordinary natural objects, which manifested itself among the painters of Europe, at the moment
when the invention of printing superseded their legendary labors, was no false instinct. It
was misunderstood and misapplied, but it came at the right time, and has maintained itself
through all kinds of abuse; presenting in the recent schools of landscape, perhaps only the
first fruits of its power. That instinct was urging every painter in Europe at the same moment
to his true duty--the faithful representation of all objects of historical interest, or of
natural beauty existent at the period; representations such as might at once aid the advance
of the sciences, and keep faithful record of every monument of past ages which was likely to
be swept away in the approaching eras of revolutionary change.

The instinct came, as I said, exactly at the right moment; and let the reader consider what
amount and kind of general knowledge might by this time have been possessed by the nations
of Europe, had their painters understood and obeyed it. Suppose that, after disciplining themselves
so as to be able to draw, with unerring precision, each the particular kind of subject in which
he most delighted, they had separated into two great armies of historians and naturalists;--that
the first had painted with absolute faithfulness every edifice, every city, every battle-field,
every scene of the slightest historical interest, precisely and completely rendering their
aspect at the time; and that their companions, according to their several powers, had painted
with like fidelity the plants and animals, the natural scenery, and the atmospheric phenomena
of every country on the earth--suppose that a faithful and complete record were now in our
museums of every building destroyed by war, or time, or innovation, during these last 200 years--suppose
that each recess of every mountain chain of Europe had been penetrated, and its rocks drawn
with such accuracy that the geologist's diagram was no longer necessary--suppose that every
tree of the forest had been drawn in its noblest aspect, every beast of the field in its savage
life--that all these gatherings were already in our national galleries, and that the painters
of the present day were laboring, happily and earnestly, to multiply them, and put such means
of knowledge more and more within reach of the common people--would not that be a more honorable
life for them, than gaining precarious bread by "bright effects?" They think not, perhaps.
They think it easy, and therefore contemptible, to be truthful; they have been taught so all
their lives. But it is not so, whoever taught it them. It is most difficult, and worthy of
the greatest men's greatest effort, to render, as it should be rendered, the simplest of the
natural features of the earth; but also be it remembered, no man is confined to the simplest;
each may look out work for himself where he chooses, and it will be strange if he cannot find
something hard enough for him. The excuse is, however, one of the lips only; for every painter
knows that when he draws back from the attempt to render nature as she is, it is oftener in
cowardice than in disdain.

I must leave the reader to pursue this subject for himself; I have not space to suggest to
him the tenth part of the advantages which would follow, both to the painter from such an understanding
of his mission, and to the whole people, in the results of his labor. Consider how the man
himself would be elevated: how content he would become, how earnest, how full of all accurate
and noble knowledge, how free from envy--knowing creation to be infinite, feeling at once the
value of what he did, and yet the nothingness. Consider the advantage to the people; the immeasurably
larger interest given to art itself; the easy, pleasurable, and perfect knowledge conveyed
by it, in every subject; the far greater number of men who might be healthily and profitably
occupied with it as a means of livelihood; the useful direction of myriads of inferior talents,
now left fading away in misery. Conceive all this, and then look around at our exhibitions,
and behold the "cattle pieces," and "sea pieces," and "fruit pieces," and "family pieces;"
the eternal brown cows in ditches, and white sails in squalls, and sliced lemons in saucers,
and foolish faces in simpers;--and try to feel what we are, and what we might have been.

Take a single instance in one branch of archæology. Let those who are interested in the history
of religion consider what a treasure we should now have possessed, if, instead of painting
pots, and vegetables, and drunken peasantry, the most accurate painters of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries had been set to copy, line for line, the religious and domestic sculpture
on the German, Flemish, and French cathedrals and castles; and if every building destroyed
in the French or in any other subsequent revolution, had thus been drawn in all its parts with
the same precision with which Gerard Douw or Mieris paint bas-reliefs of Cupids. Consider,
even now, what incalculable treasure is still left in ancient bas-reliefs, full of every kind
of legendary interest, of subtle expression, of priceless evidence as to the character, feelings
habits, histories, of past generations, in neglected and shattered churches and domestic buildings,
rapidly disappearing over the whole of Europe--treasure which, once lost, the labor of all
men living cannot bring back again; and then look at the myriads of men, with skill enough,
if they had but the commonest schooling, to record all this faithfully, who are making their
bread by drawing dances of naked women from academy models, or idealities of chivalry fitted
out with Wardour Street armor, or eternal scenes from Gil Blas, Don Quixote, and the Vicar
of Wakefield, or mountain sceneries with young idiots of Londoners wearing Highland bonnets
and brandishing rifles in the foregrounds. Do but think of these things in the breadth of their
inexpressible imbecility, and then go and stand before that broken bas-relief in the southern
gate of Lincoln Cathedral, and see if there is no fibre of the heart in you that will break too.

But is there to be no place left, it will be indignantly asked, for imagination and invention,
for poetical power, or love of ideal beauty? Yes; the highest, the noblest place--that which
these only can attain when they are all used in the cause, and with the aid of truth. Wherever
imagination and sentiment are, they will either show themselves without forcing, or, if capable
of artificial development, the kind of training which such a school of art would give them
would be the best they could receive. The infinite absurdity and failure of our present training
consists mainly in this, that we do not rank imagination and invention high enough, and suppose
that they can be taught. Throughout every sentence that I ever have written, the reader will
find the same rank attributed to these powers,--the rank of a purely divine gift, not to be
attained, increased, or in any wise modified by teaching, only in various ways capable of being
concealed or quenched. Understand this thoroughly; know once for all, that a poet on canvas
is exactly the same species of creature as a poet in song, and nearly every error in our methods
of teaching will be done away with. For who among us now thinks of bringing men up to be poets?--of
producing poets by any kind of general recipe or method of cultivation? Suppose even that we
see in youth that which we hope may, in its development, become a power of this kind, should
we instantly, supposing that we wanted to make a poet of him, and nothing else, forbid him
all quiet, steady, rational labor? Should we force him to perpetual spinning of new crudities
out of his boyish brain, and set before him, as the only objects of his study, the laws of
versification which criticism has supposed itself to discover in the works of previous writers?
Whatever gifts the boy had, would much be likely to come of them so treated? unless, indeed,
they were so great as to break through all such snares of falsehood and vanity, and build their
own foundation in spite of us; whereas if, as in cases numbering millions against units, the
natural gifts were too weak to do this, could any thing come of such training but utter inanity
and spuriousness of the whole man? But if we had sense, should we not rather restrain and bridle
the first flame of invention in early youth, heaping material on it as one would on the first
sparks and tongues of a fire which we desired to feed into greatness? Should we not educate
the whole intellect into general strength, and all the affections into warmth and honesty,
and look to heaven for the rest? This, I say, we should have sense enough to do, in order to
produce a poet in words: but, it being required to produce a poet on canvas, what is our way
of setting to work? We begin, in all probability, by telling the youth of fifteen or sixteen,
that Nature is full of faults, and that he is to improve her; but that Raphael is perfection,
and that the more he copies Raphael the better; that after much copying of Raphael, he is to
try what he can do himself in a Raphaelesque, but yet original, manner: that is to say, he
is to try to do something very clever, all out of his own head, but yet this clever something
is to be properly subjected to Raphaelesque rules, is to have a principal light occupying one-seventh
of its space, and a principle shadow occupying one-third of the same; that no two people's
heads in the picture are to be turned the same way, and that all the personages represented
are to possess ideal beauty of the highest order, which ideal beauty consists partly in a Greek
outline of nose, partly in proportions expressible in decimal fractions between the lips and
chin; but partly also in that degree of improvement which the youth of sixteen is to bestow
upon God's work in general. This I say is the kind of teaching which through various channels,
Royal Academy lecturings, press criticisms, public enthusiasm, and not least by solid weight
of gold, we give to our young men. And we wonder we have no painters!

But we do worse than this. Within the last few years some sense of the real tendency of such
teaching has appeared in some of our younger painters. It only could appear in the younger
ones, our older men having become familiarised with the false system, or else having passed
through it and forgotten it, not well knowing the degree of harm they had sustained. This sense
appeared, among our youths,--increased,--matured into resolute action. Necessarily, to exist
at all, it needed the support both of strong instincts and of considerable self-confidence,
otherwise it must at once have been borne down by the weight of general authority and received
canon law. Strong instincts are apt to make men strange, and rude; self-confidence, however
well founded, to give much of what they do or say the appearance of impertinence. Look at the
self-confidence of Wordsworth, stiffening every other sentence of his prefaces into defiance;
there is no more of it than was needed to enable him to do his work, yet it is not a little
ungraceful here and there. Suppose this stubbornness and self-trust in a youth, laboring in
an art of which the executive part is confessedly to be best learnt from masters, and we shall
hardly wonder that much of his work has a certain awkwardness and stiffness in it, or that
he should be regarded with disfavor by many, even the most temperate, of the judges trained
in the system he was breaking through, and with utter contempt and reprobation by the envious
and the dull. Consider, farther, that the particular system to be overthrown was, in the present
case, one of which the main characteristic was the pursuit of beauty at the expense of manliness
and truth; and it will seem likely, à priori, that the men intended successfully to resist
the influence of such a system should be endowed with little natural sense of beauty, and thus
rendered dead to the temptation it presented. Summing up these conditions, there is surely
little cause for surprise that pictures painted, in a temper of resistance, by exceedingly
young men, of stubborn instincts and positive self-trust, and with little natural perception
of beauty, should not be calculated, at the first glance, to win us from works enriched by
plagiarism, polished by convention, invested with all the attractiveness of artificial grace,
and recommended to our respect by established authority.

We should, however, on the other hand, have anticipated, that in proportion to the strength
of character required for the effort, and to the absence of distracting sentiments, whether
respect for precedent, or affection for ideal beauty, would be the energy exhibited in the
pursuit of the special objects which the youths proposed to themselves, and their success in
attaining them.

All this has actually been the case, but in a degree which it would have been impossible to
anticipate. That two youths, of the respective ages of eighteen and twenty, should have conceived
for themselves a totally independent and sincere method of study, and enthusiastically persevered
in it against every kind of dissuasion and opposition, is strange enough; that in the third
or fourth year of their efforts they should have produced works in many parts not inferior
to the best of Albert Durer, this is perhaps not less strange. But the loudness and universality
of the howl which the common critics of the press have raised against them, the utter absence
of all generous help or encouragement from those who can both measure their toil and appreciate
their success, and the shrill, shallow laughter of those who can do neither the one nor the
other,--these are strangest of all--unimaginable unless they had been experienced.

And as if these were not enough, private malice is at work against them, in its own small,
slimy way. The very day after I had written my second letter to the Times in the defence of
the Pre-Raphaelites, I received an anonymous letter respecting one of them, from some person
apparently hardly capable of spelling, and about as vile a specimen of petty malignity as ever
blotted paper. I think it well that the public should know this, and so get some insight into
the sources of the spirit which is at work against these men--how first roused it is difficult
to say, for one would hardly have thought that mere eccentricity in young artists could have
excited an hostility so determined and so cruel;--hostility which hesitated at no assertion,
however impudent. That of the "absence of perspective" was one of the most curious pieces of
the hue and cry which began with the Times, and died away in feeble maundering in the Art Union;
I contradicted it in the Times--I here contradict it directly for the second time. There was
not a single error in perspective in three out of the four pictures in question. But if otherwise,
would it have been anything remarkable in them? I doubt, if with the exception of the pictures
of David Roberts, there were one architectural drawing in perspective on the walls of the Academy;
I never met but with two men in my life who knew enough of perspective to draw a Gothic arch
in a retiring plane, so that its lateral dimensions and curvatures might be calculated to scale
from the drawing. Our architects certainly do not, and it was but the other day that, talking
to one of the most distinguished among them, the author of several most valuable works, I found
he actually did not know how to draw a circle in perspective. And in this state of general
science our writers for the press take it upon them to tell us, that the forest trees in Mr.
Hunt's Sylvia, and the bunches of lilies in Mr. Collins's Convent Thoughts, are out of perspective.[97]

It might not, I think, in such circumstances, have been ungraceful or unwise in the Academicians
themselves to have defended their young pupils, at least by the contradiction of statements
directly false respecting them,[98] and the direction of the mind and sight of the public to
such real merit as they possess. If Sir Charles Eastlake, Mulready, Edwin and Charles Landseer,
Cope, and Dyce would each of them simply state their own private opinion respecting their paintings,
sign it and publish it, I believe the act would be of more service to English art than any
thing the Academy has done since it was founded. But as I cannot hope for this, I can only
ask the public to give their pictures careful examination, and look at them at once with the
indulgence and the respect which I have endeavored to show they deserve.

Yet let me not be misunderstood. I have adduced them only as examples of the kind of study
which I would desire to see substituted for that of our modern schools, and of singular success
in certain characters, finish of detail, and brilliancy of color. What faculties, higher than
imitative, may be in these men, I do not yet venture to say; but I do say that if they exist,
such faculties will manifest themselves in due time all the more forcibly because they have
received training so severe.

For it is always to be remembered that no one mind is like another, either in its powers or
perceptions; and while the main principles of training must be the same for all, the result
in each will be as various as the kinds of truth which each will apprehend; therefore, also,
the modes of effort, even in men whose inner principles and final aims are exactly the same.
Suppose, for instance, two men, equally honest, equally industrious, equally impressed with
a humble desire to render some part of what they saw in nature faithfully; and, otherwise trained
in convictions such as I have above endeavored to induce. But one of them is quiet in temperament,
has a feeble memory, no invention, and excessively keen sight. The other is impatient in temperament,
has a memory which nothing escapes, an invention which never rests, and is comparatively near-sighted.

Set them both free in the same field in a mountain valley. One sees everything, small and large,
with almost the same clearness; mountains and grasshoppers alike; the leaves on the branches,
the veins in the pebbles, the bubbles in the stream: but he can remember nothing, and invent
nothing. Patiently he sets himself to his mighty task; abandoning at once all thoughts of seizing
transient effects, or giving general impressions of that which his eyes present to him in microscopical
dissection, he chooses some small portion out of the infinite scene, and calculates with courage
the number of weeks which must elapse before he can do justice to the intensity of his perceptions,
or the fulness of matter in his subject.

Meantime, the other has been watching the change of the clouds, and the march of the light
along the mountain sides; he beholds the entire scene in broad, soft masses of true gradation,
and the very feebleness of his sight is in some sort an advantage to him, in making him more
sensible of the aërial mystery of distance, and hiding from him the multitudes of circumstances
which it would have been impossible for him to represent. But there is not one change in the
casting of the jagged shadows along the hollows of the hills, but it is fixed on his mind for
ever; not a flake of spray has broken from the sea of cloud about their bases, but he has watched
it as it melts away, and could recall it to its lost place in heaven by the slightest effort
of his thoughts. Not only so, but thousands and thousands of such images, of older scenes,
remain congregated in his mind, each mingling in new associations with those now visibly passing
before him, and these again confused with other images of his own ceaseless, sleepless imagination,
flashing by in sudden troops. Fancy how his paper will be covered with stray symbols and blots,
and undecipherable shorthand:--as for his sitting down to "draw from Nature," there was not
one of the things which he wished to represent that stayed for so much as five seconds together:
but none of them escaped, for all that: they are sealed up in that strange storehouse of his;
he may take one of them out, perhaps, this day twenty years, and paint it in his dark room,
far away. Now, observe, you may tell both of these men, when they are young, that they are
to be honest, that they have an important function, and that they are not to care what Raphael
did. This you may wholesomely impress on them both. But fancy the exquisite absurdity of expecting
either of them to possess any of the qualities of the other.

I have supposed the feebleness of sight in the last, and of invention in the first painter,
that the contrast between them might be more striking; but, with very slight modification,
both the characters are real. Grant to the first considerable inventive power, with exquisite
sense of color; and give to the second, in addition to all his other faculties, the eye of
an eagle; and the first is John Everett Millais, the second Joseph Mallard William Turner.

They are among the few men who have defied all false teaching, and have, therefore, in great
measure, done justice to the gifts with which they were entrusted. They stand at opposite poles,
marking culminating points of art in both directions; between them, or in various relations
to them, we may class five or six more living artists who, in like manner, have done justice
to their powers. I trust that I may be pardoned for naming them, in order that the reader may
know how the strong innate genius in each has been invariably accompanied with the same humility,
earnestness, and industry in study.

It is hardly necessary to point out the earnestness or humility in the works of William Hunt;
but it may be so to suggest the high value they possess as records of English rural life, and
still life. Who is there who for a moment could contend with him in the unaffected, yet humorous
truth with which he has painted our peasant children? Who is there who does not sympathize
with him in the simple love with which he dwells on the brightness and bloom of our summer
fruit and flowers? And yet there is something to be regretted concerning him: why should he
be allowed continually to paint the same bunches of hot-house grapes, and supply to the Water
Color Society a succession of pineapples with the regularity of a Covent Garden fruiterer?
He has of late discovered that primrose banks are lovely; but there are other things grow wild
besides primroses: what undreamt-of loveliness might he not bring back to us, if he would lose
himself for a summer in Highland foregrounds; if he would paint the heather as it grows, and
the foxglove and the harebell as they nestle in the clefts of the rocks, and the mosses and
bright lichens of the rocks themselves. And then, cross to the Jura, and bring back a piece
of Jura pasture in spring; with the gentians in their earliest blue, and the soldanelle beside
the fading snow! And return again, and paint a gray wall of Alpine crag, with budding roses
crowning it like a wreath of rubies. That is what he was meant to do in this world; not to
paint bouquets in china vases.

I have in various other places expressed my sincere respect for the works of Samuel Prout:
his shortness of sight has necessarily prevented their possessing delicacy of finish or fulness
of minor detail; but I think that those of no other living artist furnish an example so striking
of innate and special instinct, sent to do a particular work at the exact and only period when
it was possible. At the instant when peace had been established all over Europe, but when neither
national character nor national architecture had as yet been seriously changed by promiscuous
intercourse or modern "improvement;" when, however, nearly every ancient and beautiful building
had been long left in a state of comparative neglect, so that its aspect of partial ruinousness,
and of separation from recent active life, gave to every edifice a peculiar interest--half
sorrowful, half sublime;--at that moment Prout was trained among the rough rocks and simple
cottages of Cornwall, until his eye was accustomed to follow with delight the rents and breaks,
and irregularities which, to another man, would have been offensive; and then, gifted with
infinite readiness in composition, but also with infinite affection for the kind of subjects
he had to portray, he was sent to preserve, in an almost innumerable series of drawings, every
one made on the spot, the aspect borne, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, by cities
which, in a few years more, rekindled wars, or unexpected prosperities, were to ravage, or
renovate, into nothingness.

It seems strange to pass from Prout to John Lewis; but there is this fellowship between them,
that both seem to have been intended to appreciate the characters of foreign countries more
than of their own--nay, to have been born in England chiefly that the excitement of strangeness
might enhance to them the interest of the scenes they had to represent. I believe John Lewis
to have done more entire justice to all his powers (and they are magnificent ones) than any
other man amongst us. His mission was evidently to portray the comparatively animal life of
the southern and eastern families of mankind. For this he was prepared in a somewhat singular
way--by being led to study, and endowed with altogether peculiar apprehension of, the most
sublime characters of animals themselves. Rubens, Rembrandt, Snyders, Tintoret, and Titian,
have all, in various ways, drawn wild beasts magnificently; but they have in some sort humanized
or demonized them, making them either ravenous fiends or educated beasts, that would draw cars,
and had respect for hermits. The sullen isolation of the brutal nature; the dignity and quietness
of the mighty limbs; the shaggy mountainous power, mingled with grace, as of a flowing stream;
the stealthy restraint of strength and wrath in every soundless motion of the gigantic frame;
all this seems never to have been seen, much less drawn, until Lewis drew and himself engraved
a series of animal subjects, now many years ago. Since then, he has devoted himself to the
portraiture of those European and Asiatic races, among whom the refinements of civilization
exist without its laws or its energies, and in whom the fierceness, indolence, and subtlety
of animal nature are associated with brilliant imagination and strong affections. To this task
he has brought not only intense perception of the kind of character, but powers of artistical
composition like those of the great Venetians, displaying, at the same time, a refinement of
drawing almost miraculous, and appreciable only, as the minutiæ of nature itself are appreciable,
by the help of the microscope. The value, therefore, of his works, as records of the aspect
of the scenery and inhabitants of the south of Spain and of the East, in the earlier part of
the nineteenth century, is quite above all estimate.

I hardly know how to speak of Mulready: in delicacy and completion of drawing, and splendor
of color, he takes place beside John Lewis and the pre-Raphaelites; but he has, throughout
his career, displayed no definiteness in choice of subject. He must be named among the painters
who have studied with industry, and have made themselves great by doing so; but having obtained
a consummate method of execution, he has thrown it away on subjects either altogether uninteresting,
or above his powers, or unfit for pictorial representation. "The Cherry Woman," exhibited in
1850, may be named as an example of the first kind; the "Burchell and Sophia" of the second
(the character of Sir William Thornhill being utterly missed); the "Seven Ages" of the third;
for this subject cannot be painted. In the written passage, the thoughts are progressive and
connected; in the picture they must be co-existent, and yet separate; nor can all the characters
of the ages be rendered in painting at all. One may represent the soldier at the cannon's mouth,
but one cannot paint the "bubble reputation" which he seeks. Mulready, therefore, while he
has always produced exquisite pieces of painting, has failed in doing anything which can be
of true or extensive use. He has, indeed, understood how to discipline his genius, but never
how to direct it.

Edwin Landseer is the last painter but one whom I shall name: I need not point out to any one
acquainted with his earlier works, the labor, or watchfulness of nature which they involve,
nor need I do more than allude to the peculiar faculties of his mind. It will at once be granted
that the highest merits of his pictures are throughout found in those parts of them which are
least like what had before been accomplished; and that it was not by the study of Raphael that
he attained his eminent success, but by a healthy love of Scotch terriers.

None of these painters, however, it will be answered, afford examples of the rise of the highest
imaginative power out of close study of matters of fact. Be it remembered, however, that the
imaginative power, in its magnificence, is not to be found every day. Lewis has it in no mean
degree; but we cannot hope to find it at its highest more than once in an age. We have had
it once, and must be content.

Towards the close of the last century, among the various drawings executed, according to the
quiet manner of the time, in greyish blue, with brown foregrounds, some began to be noticed
as exhibiting rather more than ordinary diligence and delicacy, signed W. Turner.[99] There
was nothing, however, in them at all indicative of genius, or even of more than ordinary talent,
unless in some of the subjects a large perception of space, and excessive clearness and decision
in the arrangement of masses. Gradually and cautiously the blues became mingled with delicate
green, and then with gold; the browns in the foreground became first more positive, and then
were slightly mingled with other local colors; while the touch, which had at first been heavy
and broken, like that of the ordinary drawing masters of the time, grew more and more refined
and expressive, until it lost itself in a method of execution often too delicate for the eye
to follow, rendering, with a precision before unexampled, both the texture and the form of
every object. The style may be considered as perfectly formed about the year 1800, and it remained
unchanged for twenty years.

During that period the painter had attempted, and with more or less success had rendered, every
order of landscape subject, but always on the same principle, subduing the colors of nature
into a harmony of which the key-notes are greyish green and brown; pure blues and delicate
golden yellows being admitted in small quantity, as the lowest and highest limits of shade
and light: and bright local colors in extremely small quantity in figures or other minor accessories.

Pictures executed on such a system are not, properly speaking, works in color at all; they
are studies of light and shade, in which both the shade and the distance are rendered in the
general hue which best expresses their attributes of coolness and transparency; and the lights
and the foreground are executed in that which best expresses their warmth and solidity. This
advantage may just as well be taken as not, in studies of light and shadow to be executed with
the hand: but the use of two, three, or four colors, always in the same relations and places,
does not in the least constitute the work a study of color, any more than the brown engravings
of the Liber Studiorum; nor would the idea of color be in general more present to the artist's
mind, when he was at work on one of these drawings, than when he was using pure brown in the
mezzotint engraving. But the idea of space, warmth, and freshness being not successfully expressible
in a single tint, and perfectly expressible by the admission of three or four, he allows himself
this advantage when it is possible, without in the least embarrassing himself with the actual
color of the objects to be represented. A stone in the fore ground might in nature have been
cold grey, but it will be drawn nevertheless of a rich brown, because it is in the foreground;
a hill in the distance might in nature be purple with heath, or golden with furze; but it will
be drawn nevertheless of a cool grey, because it is in the distance.

This at least was the general theory,--carried out with great severity in many, both of the
drawings and pictures executed by him during the period: in others more or less modified by
the cautious introduction of color, as the painter felt his liberty increasing; for the system
was evidently never considered as final, or as anything more than a means of progress: the
conventional, easily manageable color, was visibly adopted, only that his mind might be at
perfect liberty to address itself to the acquirement of the first and most necessary knowledge
in all art--that of form. But as form, in landscape, implies vast bulk and space, the use of
the tints which enabled him best to express them, was actually auxiliary to the mere drawing;
and, therefore, not only permissible, but even necessary, while more brilliant or varied tints
were never indulged in, except when they might be introduced without the slightest danger of
diverting his mind for an instant from his principal object. And, therefore, it will be generally
found in the works of this period, that exactly in proportion to the importance and general
toil of the composition, is the severity of the tint; and that the play of color begins to
show itself first in slight and small drawings, where he felt that he could easily secure all
that he wanted in form.

Thus the "Crossing the Brook," and such other elaborate and large compositions, are actually
painted in nothing but grey, brown, and blue, with a point or two of severe local color in
the figures; but in the minor drawings, tender passages of complicated color occur not unfrequently
in easy places; and even before the year 1800 he begins to introduce it with evident joyfulness
and longing in his rude and simple studies, just as a child, if it could be supposed to govern
itself by a fully developed intellect, would cautiously, but with infinite pleasure, add now
and then a tiny dish of fruit or other dangerous luxury to the simple order of its daily fare.
Thus, in the foregrounds of his most severe drawings, we not unfrequently find him indulging
in the luxury of a peacock; and it is impossible to express the joyfulness with which he seems
to design its graceful form, and deepen with soft pencilling the bloom of its blue, after he
has worked through the stern detail of his almost colorless drawing. A rainbow is another of
his most frequently permitted indulgences; and we find him very early allowing the edges of
his evening clouds to be touched with soft rose-color or gold; while, whenever the hues of
nature in anywise fall into his system, and can be caught without a dangerous departure from
it, he instantly throws his whole soul into the faithful rendering of them. Thus the usual
brown tones of his foreground become warmed into sudden vigor, and are varied and enhanced
with indescribable delight, when he finds himself by the shore of a moorland stream, where
they truly express the stain of its golden rocks, and the darkness of its clear, Cairngorm-like
pools, and the usual serenity of his aërial blue is enriched into the softness and depth of
the sapphire, when it can deepen the distant slumber of some Highland lake, or temper the gloomy
shadows of the evening upon its hills.

The system of his color being thus simplified, he could address all the strength of his mind
to the accumulation of facts of form; his choice of subject, and his methods of treatment,
are therefore as various as his color is simple; and it is not a little difficult to give the
reader who is unacquainted with his works, an idea either of their infinitude of aims, on the
one hand, or of the kind of feeling which prevades them all, on the other. No subject was too
low or too high for him; we find him one day hard at work on a cock and hen, with their family
of chickens in a farm-yard; and bringing all the refinement of his execution into play to express
the texture of the plumage; next day, he is drawing the Dragon of Colchis. One hour he is much
interested in a gust of wind blowing away an old woman's cap; the next he is painting the fifth
plague of Egypt. Every landscape painter before him had acquired distinction by confining his
efforts to one class of subject. Hobbima painted oaks; Ruysdael, waterfalls and copses; Cuyp,
river or meadow scenes in quiet afternoons; Salvator and Poussin, such kind of mountain scenery
as people could conceive, who lived in towns in the seventeenth century. But I am well persuaded
that if all the works of Turner, up to the year 1820, were divided into classes (as he has
himself divided them in the Liber Studiorum), no preponderance could be assigned to one class
over another. There is architecture, including a large number of formal "gentlemen's seats,"
I suppose drawings commissioned by the owners; then lowland pastoral scenery of every kind,
including nearly all farming operations,--ploughing, harrowing, hedging and ditching, felling
trees, sheep-washing, and I know not what else; then all kinds of town life--court-yards of
inns, starting of mail coaches, interiors of shops, house-buildings, fairs, elections, &c.;
then all kinds of inner domestic life--interiors of rooms, studies of costumes, of still life,
and heraldry, including multitudes of symbolical vignettes; then marine scenery of every kind,
full of local incident; every kind of boat and method of fishing for particular fish, being
specifically drawn, round the whole coast of England;--pilchard fishing at St. Ives, whiting
fishing at Margate, herring at Loch Fyne; and all kinds of shipping, including studies of every
separate part of the vessels, and many marine battle-pieces, two in particular of Trafalgar,
both of high importance,--one of the Victory after the battle, now in Greenwich Hospital; another
of the Death of Nelson, in his own gallery; then all kinds of mountain scenery, some idealised
into compositions, others of definite localities; together with classical compositions, Romes
and Carthages and such others, by the myriad, with mythological, historical, or allegorical
figures,--nymphs, monsters, and spectres; heroes and divinities.[100]

What general feeling, it may be asked incredulously, can possibly pervade all this? This, the
greatest of all feelings--an utter forgetfulness of self. Throughout the whole period with
which we are at present concerned, Turner appears as a man of sympathy absolutely infinite--a
sympathy so all-embracing, that I know nothing but that of Shakespeare comparable with it.
A soldier's wife resting by the roadside is not beneath it; Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, watching
the dead bodies of her sons, not above it. Nothing can possibly be so mean as that it will
not interest his whole mind, and carry away his whole heart; nothing so great or solemn but
that he can raise himself into harmony with it; and it is impossible to prophesy of him at
any moment, whether, the next, he will be in laughter or in tears.

This is the root of the man's greatness; and it follows as a matter of course that this sympathy
must give him a subtle power of expression, even of the characters of mere material things,
such as no other painter ever possessed. The man who can best feel the difference between rudeness
and tenderness in humanity, perceives also more difference between the branches of an oak and
a willow than any one else would; and therefore, necessarily the most striking character of
the drawings themselves is the speciality of whatever they represent--the thorough stiffness
of what is stiff, and grace of what is graceful, and vastness of what is vast; but through
and beyond all this, the condition of the mind of the painter himself is easily enough discoverable
by comparison of a large number of the drawings. It is singularly serene and peaceful: in itself
quite passionless, though entering with ease into the external passion which it contemplates.
By the effort of its will it sympathises with tumult or distress, even in their extremes, but
there is no tumult, no sorrow in itself, only a chastened and exquisitely peaceful cheerfulness,
deeply meditative; touched without loss of its own perfect balance, by sadness on the one side,
and stooping to playfulness upon the other. I shall never cease to regret the destruction,
by fire, now several years ago, of a drawing which always seemed to me to be the perfect image
of the painter's mind at this period,--the drawing of Brignal Church near Rokeby, of which
a feeble idea may still be gathered from the engraving (in the Yorkshire series). The spectator
stands on the "Brignal banks," looking down into the glen at twilight; the sky is still full
of soft rays, though the sun is gone; and the Greta glances brightly in the valley, singing
its evening-song; two white clouds, following each other, move without wind through the hollows
of the ravine, and others lie couched on the far away moorlands; every leaf of the woods is
still in the delicate air; a boy's kite, incapable of rising, has become entangled in their
branches, he is climbing to recover it; and just behind it in the picture, almost indicated
by it, the lowly church is seen in its secluded field between the rocks and the stream; and
around it the low churchyard wall, and the few white stones which mark the resting places of
those who can climb the rocks no more, nor hear the river sing as it passes.

There are many other existing drawings which indicate the same character of mind, though I
think none so touching or so beautiful; yet they are not, as I said above, more numerous than
those which express his sympathy with sublimer or more active scenes; but they are almost always
marked by a tenderness of execution, and have a look of being beloved in every part of them,
which shows them to be the truest expression of his own feelings.

One other characteristic of his mind at this period remains to be noticed--its reverence for
talent in others. Not the reverence which acts upon the practices of men as if they were the
laws of nature, but that which is ready to appreciate the power, and receive the assistance,
of every mind which has been previously employed in the same direction, so far as its teaching
seems to be consistent with the great text-book of nature itself. Turner thus studied almost
every preceding landscape painter, chiefly Claude, Poussin, Vandevelde, Loutherbourg, and Wilson.
It was probably by the Sir George Beaumonts and other feeble conventionalists of the period,
that he was persuaded to devote his attention to the works of these men; and his having done
so will be thought, a few scores of years hence, evidence of perhaps the greatest modesty ever
shown by a man of original power. Modesty at once admirable and unfortunate, for the study
of the works of Vandevelde and Claude was productive of unmixed mischief to him; he spoiled
many of his marine pictures, as for instance Lord Ellesmere's, by imitation of the former;
and from the latter learned a false ideal, which confirmed by the notions of Greek art prevalent
in London in the beginning of this century, has manifested itself in many vulgarities in his
composition pictures, vulgarities which may perhaps be best expressed by the general term "Twickenham
Classicism," as consisting principally in conceptions of ancient or of rural life such as have
influenced the erection of most of our suburban villas. From Nicolo Poussin and Loutherbourg
he seems to have derived advantage; perhaps also from Wilson; and much in his subsequent travels
from far higher men, especially Tintoret and Paul Veronese. I have myself heard him speaking
with singular delight of the putting in of the beech leaves in the upper right-hand corner
of Titian's Peter Martyr. I cannot in any of his works trace the slightest influence of Salvator;
and I am not surprised at it, for though Salvator was a man of far higher powers than either
Vandevelde or Claude, he was a wilful and gross caricaturist. Turner would condescend to be
helped by feeble men, but could not be corrupted by false men. Besides, he had never himself
seen classical life, and Claude was represented to him as competent authority for it. But he
had seen mountains and torrents, and knew therefore that Salvator could not paint them.

One of the most characteristic drawings of this period fortunately bears a date, 1818, and
brings us within two years of another dated drawing, no less characteristic of what I shall
henceforward call Turner's Second period. It is in the possession of Mr. Hawkesworth Fawkes
of Farnley, one of Turner's earliest and truest friends; and bears the inscription, unusually
conspicuous, heaving itself up and down over the eminences of the foreground--"PASSAGE OF MONT
CENIS. J. M. W. TURNER, January 15th, 1820."

The scene is on the summit of the pass close to the hospice, or what seems to have been a hospice
at that time,--I do not remember such at present,--a small square-built house, built as if
partly for a fortress, with a detached flight of stone steps in front of it, and a kind of
drawbridge to the door. This building, about 400 or 500 yards off, is seen in a dim, ashy grey
against the light, which by help of a violent blast of mountain wind has broken through the
depth of clouds which hangs upon the crags. There is no sky, properly so called, nothing but
this roof of drifting cloud; but neither is there any weight of darkness--the high air is too
thin for it,--all savage, howling, and luminous with cold, the massy bases of the granite hills
jutting out here and there grimly through the snow wreaths. There is a desolate-looking refuge
on the left, with its number 16, marked on it in long ghastly figures, and the wind is drifting
the snow off the roof and through its window in a frantic whirl; the near ground is all wan
with half-thawed, half-trampled snow; a diligence in front, whose horses, unable to face the
wind, have turned right round with fright, its passengers struggling to escape, jammed in the
window; a little farther on is another carriage off the road, some figures pushing at its wheels,
and its driver at the horses' heads, pulling and lashing with all his strength, his lifted
arm stretched out against the light of the distance, though too far off for the whip to be seen.

Now I am perfectly certain that any one thoroughly accustomed to the earlier works of the painter,
and shown this picture for the first time, would be struck by two altogether new characters in it.

The first, a seeming enjoyment of the excitement of the scene, totally different from the contemplative
philosophy with which it would formerly have been regarded. Every incident of motion and of
energy is seized upon with indescribable delight, and every line of the composition animated
with a force and fury which are now no longer the mere expression of a contemplated external
truth, but have origin in some inherent feeling in the painter's mind.

The second, that although the subject is one in itself almost incapable of color, and although,
in order to increase the wildness of the impression, all brilliant local color has been refused
even where it might easily have been introduced, as in the figures; yet in the low minor key
which has been chosen, the melodies of color have been elaborated to the utmost possible pitch,
so as to become a leading, instead of a subordinate, element in the composition; the subdued
warm hues of the granite promontories, the dull stone color of the walls of the buildings,
clearly opposed, even in shade, to the grey of the snow wreaths heaped against them, and the
faint greens and ghastly blues of the glacier ice, being all expressed with delicacies of transition
utterly unexampled in any previous drawings.

These, accordingly, are the chief characteristics of the works of Turner's second period, as
distinguished from the first,--a new energy inherent in the mind of the painter, diminishing
the repose and exalting the force and fire of his conceptions, and the presence of Color, as
at least an essential, and often a principal, element of design.

Not that it is impossible, or even unusual, to find drawings of serene subject, and perfectly
quiet feeling, among the compositions of this period; but the repose is in them, just as the
energy and tumult were in the earlier period, an external quality, which the painter images
by an effort of the will: it is no longer a character inherent in himself. The "Ulleswater,"
in the England series, is one of those which are in most perfect peace: in the "Cowes," the
silence is only broken by the dash of the boat's oars, and in the "Alnwick" by a stag drinking;
but in at least nine drawings out of ten, either sky, water, or figures are in rapid motion,
and the grandest drawings are almost always those which have even violent action in one or
other, or in all: e. g. high force of Tees, Coventry, Llanthony, Salisbury, Llanberis, and
such others.

The color is, however, a more absolute distinction; and we must return to Mr. Fawkes's collection
in order to see how the change in it was effected. That such a change would take place at one
time or other was of course to be securely anticipated, the conventional system of the first
period being, as above stated, merely a means of Study. But the immediate cause was the journey
of the year 1820. As might be guessed from the legend on the drawing above described, "Passage
of Mont Cenis, January 15th, 1820," that drawing represents what happened on the day in question
to the painter himself. He passed the Alps then in the winter of 1820; and either in the previous
or subsequent summer, but on the same journey, he made a series of sketches on the Rhine, in
body color, now in Mr. Fawkes's collection. Every one of those sketches is the almost instantaneous
record of an effect of color or atmosphere, taken strictly from nature, the drawing and the
details of every subject being comparatively subordinate, and the color nearly as principal
as the light and shade had been before,--certainly the leading feature, though the light and
shade are always exquisitely harmonized with it. And naturally, as the color becomes the leading
object, those times of day are chosen in which it is most lovely; and whereas before, at least
five out of six of Turner's drawings represented ordinary daylight, we now find his attention
directed constantly to the evening: and, for the first time, we have those rosy lights upon
the hills, those gorgeous falls of sun through flaming heavens, those solemn twilights, with
the blue moon rising as the western sky grows dim, which have ever since been the themes of
his mightiest thoughts.

I have no doubt, that the immediate reason of this change was the impression made upon him
by the colors of the continental skies. When he first travelled on the Continent (1800), he
was comparatively a young student; not yet able to draw form as he wanted, he was forced to
give all his thoughts and strength to this primary object. But now he was free to receive other
impressions; the time was come for perfecting his art, and the first sunset which he saw on
the Rhine taught him that all previous landscape art was vain and valueless, that in comparison
with natural color, the things that had been called paintings were mere ink and charcoal, and
that all precedent and all authority must be cast away at once, and trodden under foot. He
cast them away: the memories of Vandevelde and Claude were at once weeded out of the great
mind they had encumbered; they and all the rubbish of the schools together with them; the waves
of the Rhine swept them away for ever; and a new dawn rose over the rocks of the Siebengebirge.

There was another motive at work, which rendered the change still more complete. His fellow
artists were already conscious enough of his superior power in drawing, and their best hope
was, that he might not be able to color. They had begun to express this hope loudly enough
for it to reach his ears. The engraver of one of his most important marine pictures told me,
not long ago, that one day about the period in question, Turner came into his room to examine
the progress of the plate, not having seen his own picture for several months. It was one of
his dark early pictures, but in the foreground was a little piece of luxury, a pearly fish
wrought into hues like those of an opal. He stood before the picture for some moments; then
laughed, and pointed joyously to the fish;--"They say that Turner can't color!" and turned away.

Under the force of these various impulses the change was total. Every subject thenceforth was
primarily conceived in color; and no engraving ever gave the slightest idea of any drawing
of this period.

The artists who had any perception of the truth were in despair; the Beaumontites, classicalists,
and "owl species" in general, in as much indignation as their dulness was capable of. They
had deliberately closed their eyes to all nature, and had gone on inquiring, "Where do you
put your brown tree?" A vast revelation was made to them at once, enough to have dazzled any
one; but to them, light unendurable as incomprehensible. They "did to the moon complain," in
one vociferous, unanimous, continuous "Tu whoo." Shrieking rose from all dark places at the
same instant, just the same kind of shrieking that is now raised against the Pre-Raphaelites.
Those glorious old Arabian Nights, how true they are! Mocking and whispering, and abuse loud
and low by turns, from all the black stones beside the road, when one living soul is toiling
up the hill to get the golden water. Mocking and whispering, that he may look back, and become
a black stone like themselves.

Turner looked not back, but he went on in such a temper as a strong man must be in, when he
is forced to walk with his fingers in his ears. He retired into himself; he could look no longer
for help, or counsel, or sympathy from any one; and the spirit of defiance in which he was
forced to labor led him sometimes into violences, from which the slightest expression of sympathy
would have saved him. The new energy that was upon him, and the utter isolation into which
he was driven, were both alike dangerous, and many drawings of the time show the evil effects
of both; some of them being hasty, wild, or experimental, and others little more than magnificent
expressions of defiance of public opinion.

But all have this noble virtue--they are in everything his own: there are no more reminiscences
of dead masters, no more trials of skill in the manner of Claude or Poussin; every faculty
of his soul is fixed upon nature only, as he saw her, or as he remembered her.

I have spoken above of his gigantic memory: it is especially necessary to notice this, in order
that we may understand the kind of grasp which a man of real imagination takes of all things
that are once brought within his reach--grasp thenceforth not to be relaxed for ever.

On looking over any catalogues of his works, or of particular series of them, we shall notice
the recurrence of the same subject two, three, or even many times. In any other artist this
would be nothing remarkable. Probably most modern landscape painters multiply a favorite subject
twenty, thirty, or sixty fold, putting the shadows and the clouds in different places, and
"inventing," as they are pleased to call it, a new "effect" every time. But if we examine the
successions of Turner's subjects, we shall find them either the records of a succession of
impressions actually perceived by him at some favorite locality, or else repetitions of one
impression received in early youth, and again and again realised as his increasing powers enabled
him to do better justice to it. In either case we shall find them records of seen facts; never
compositions in his room to fill up a favorite outline.

For instance, every traveller, at least every traveller of thirty years' standing, must love
Calais, the place where he first felt himself in a strange world. Turner evidently loved it
excessively. I have never catalogued his studies of Calais, but I remember, at this moment,
five: there is first the "Pas de Calais," a very large oil painting, which is what he saw in
broad daylight as he crossed over, when he got near the French side. It is a careful study
of French fishing boats running for the shore before the wind, with the picturesque old city
in the distance. Then there is the "Calais Harbor" in the Liber Studiorum: that is what he
saw just as he was going into the harbor,--a heavy brig warping out, and very likely to get
in his way, or run against the pier, and bad weather coming on. Then there is the "Calais Pier,"
a large painting, engraved some years ago by Mr. Lupton:[101] that is what he saw when he had
landed, and ran back directly to the pier to see what had become of the brig. The weather had
got still worse, the fishwomen were being blown about in a distressful manner on the pier head,
and some more fishing boats were running in with all speed. Then there is the "Fortrouge,"
Calais: that is what he saw after he had been home to Dessein's, and dined, and went out again
in the evening to walk on the sands, the tide being down. He had never seen such a waste of
sands before, and it made an impression on him. The shrimp girls were all scattered over them
too, and moved about in white spots on the wild shore; and the storm had lulled a little, and
there was a sunset--such a sunset,--and the bars of Fortrouge seen against it, skeleton-wise.

He did not paint that directly; thought over it,--painted it a long while afterwards.

Then there is the vignette in the illustrations to Scott. That is what he saw as he was going
home, meditatively; and the revolving lighthouse came blazing out upon him suddenly, and disturbed
him. He did not like that so much; made a vignette of it, however, when he was asked to do
a bit of Calais, twenty or thirty years afterwards, having already done all the rest.

Turner never told me all this, but any one may see it if he will compare the pictures. They
might, possibly, not be impressions of a single day, but of two days or three; though in all
human probability they were seen just as I have stated them;[102] but they are records of successive
impressions, as plainly written as ever traveller's diary. All of them pure veracities. Therefore
immortal.

I could multiply these series almost indefinitely from the rest of his works. What is curious,
some of them have a kind of private mark running through all the subjects. Thus I know three
drawings of Scarborough, and all of them have a starfish in the foreground: I do not remember
any others of his marine subjects which have a starfish.

The other kind of repetition--the recurrence to one early impression--is however still more
remarkable. In the collection of F. H. Bale, Esq., there is a small drawing of Llanthony Abbey.
It is in his boyish manner, its date probably about 1795; evidently a sketch from nature, finished
at home. It had been a showery day; the hills were partially concealed by the rain, and gleams
of sunshine breaking out at intervals. A man was fishing in the mountain stream. The young
Turner sought a place of some shelter under the bushes; made his sketch, took great pains when
he got home to imitate the rain, as he best could; added his child's luxury of a rainbow; put
in the very bush under which he had taken shelter, and the fisherman, a somewhat ill-jointed
and long-legged fisherman, in the courtly short breeches which were the fashion of the time.

Some thirty years afterwards, with all his powers in their strongest training, and after the
total change in his feelings and principles which I have endeavored to describe, he undertook
the series of "England and Wales," and in that series introduced the subject of Llanthony Abbey.
And behold, he went back to his boy's sketch, and boy's thought. He kept the very bushes in
their places, but brought the fisherman to the other side of the river, and put him, in somewhat
less courtly dress, under their shelter, instead of himself. And then he set all his gained
strength and new knowledge at work on the well-remembered shower of rain, that had fallen thirty
years before, to do it better. The resultant drawing[103] is one of the very noblest of his
second period.

Another of the drawings of the England series, Ulleswater, is the repetition of one in Mr.
Fawkes's collection, which, by the method of its execution, I should conjecture to have been
executed about the year 1808, or 1810: at all events, it is a very quiet drawing of the first
period. The lake is quite calm; the western hills in grey shadow, the eastern massed in light.
Helvellyn rising like a mist between them, all being mirrored in the calm water. Some thin
and slightly evanescent cows are standing in the shallow water in front; a boat floats motionless
about a hundred yards from the shore: the foreground is of broken rocks, with lovely pieces
of copse on the right and left.

This was evidently Turner's record of a quiet evening by the shore of Ulleswater, but it was
a feeble one. He could not at that time render the sunset colors: he went back to it therefore
in the England series, and painted it again with his new power. The same hills are there, the
same shadows, the same cows,--they had stood in his mind, on the same spot, for twenty years,--the
same boat, the same rocks, only the copse is cut away--it interfered with the masses of his
color: some figures are introduced bathing, and what was grey, and feeble gold in the first
drawing, becomes purple, and burning rose-color in the last.

But perhaps one of the most curious examples is in the series of subjects from Winchelsea.
That in the Liber Studiorum, "Winchelsea, Sussex," bears date 1812, and its figures consist
of a soldier speaking to a woman, who is resting on the bank beside the road. There is another
small subject, with Winchelsea in the distance, of which the engraving bears date 1817. It
has two women with bundles, and two soldiers toiling along the embankment in the plain, and
a baggage waggon in the distance. Neither of these seems to have satisfied him, and at last
he did another for the England series, of which the engraving bears date 1830. There is now
a regiment on the march; the baggage waggon is there, having got no further on in the thirteen
years, but one of the women is tired, and has fainted on the bank; another is supporting her
against her bundle, and giving her drink; a third sympathetic woman is added, and the two soldiers
have stopped, and one is drinking from his canteen.

Nor is it merely of entire scenes, or of particular incidents, that Turner's memory is thus
tenacious. The slightest passages of color or arrangement that have pleased him--the fork of
a bough, the casting of a shadow, the fracture of a stone--will be taken up again and again,
and strangely worked into new relations with other thoughts. There is a single sketch from
nature in one of the portfolios at Farnley, of a common wood-walk on the estate, which has
furnished passages to no fewer than three of the most elaborate compositions in the Liber Studiorum.

I am thus tedious in dwelling on Turner's powers of memory, because I wish it to be thoroughly
seen how all his greatness, all his infinite luxuriance of invention, depends on his taking
possession of everything that he sees,--on his grasping all, and losing hold of nothing,--on
his forgetting himself, and forgetting nothing else. I wish it to be understood how every great
man paints what he sees or did see, his greatness being indeed little else than his intense
sense of fact. And thus Pre-Raphaelitism and Raphaelitism, and Turnerism, are all one and the
same, so far as education can influence them. They are different in their choice, different
in their faculties, but all the same in this, that Raphael himself, so far as he was great,
and all who preceded or followed him who ever were great, became so by painting the truths
around them as they appeared to each man's own mind, not as he had been taught to see them,
except by the God who made both him and them.

There is, however, one more characteristic of Turner's second period, on which I have still
to dwell, especially with reference to what has been above advanced respecting the fallacy
of overtoil; namely, the magnificent ease with which all is done when it is successfully done.
For there are one or two drawings of this time which are not done easily. Turner had in these
set himself to do a fine thing to exhibit his powers; in the common phrase, to excel himself;
so sure as he does this, the work is a failure. The worst drawings that have ever come from
his hands are some of this second period, on which he has spent much time and laborious thought;
drawings filled with incident from one side to the other, with skies stippled into morbid blue,
and warm lights set against them in violent contrast; one of Bamborough Castle, a large water-color,
may be named as an example. But the truly noble works are those in which, without effort, he
has expressed his thoughts as they came, and forgotten himself; and in these the outpouring
of invention is not less miraculous than the swiftness and obedience of the mighty hand that
expresses it. Any one who examines the drawings may see the evidence of this facility, in the
strange freshness and sharpness of every touch of color; but when the multitude of delicate
touches, with which all the aërial tones are worked, is taken into consideration, it would
still appear impossible that the drawing could have been completed with ease, unless we had
direct evidence in the matter: fortunately, it is not wanting. There is a drawing in Mr. Fawkes's
collection of a man-of-war taking in stores: it is of the usual size of those of the England
series, about sixteen inches by eleven: it does not appear one of the most highly finished,
but is still farther removed from slightness. The hull of a first-rate occupies nearly one-half
of the picture on the right, her bows towards the spectator, seen in sharp perspective from
stem to stern, with all her portholes, guns, anchors, and lower rigging elaborately detailed;
there are two other ships of the line in the middle distance, drawn with equal precision; a
noble breezy sea dancing against their broad bows, full of delicate drawing in its waves; a
store-ship beneath the hull of the larger vessel, and several other boats, and a complicated
cloudy sky. It might appear no small exertion of mind to draw the detail of all this shipping
down to the smallest ropes, from memory, in the drawing-room of a mansion in the middle of
Yorkshire, even if considerable time had been given for the effort. But Mr. Fawkes sat beside
the painter from the first stroke to the last. Turner took a piece of blank paper one morning
after breakfast, outlined his ships, finished the drawing in three hours, and went out to shoot.

Let this single fact be quietly meditated upon by our ordinary painters, and they will see
the truth of what was above asserted,--that if a great thing can be done at all, it can be
done easily; and let them not torment themselves with twisting of compositions this way and
that, and repeating, and experimenting, and scene-shifting. If a man can compose at all, he
can compose at once, or rather he must compose in spite of himself. And this is the reason
of that silence which I have kept in most of my works, on the subject of Composition. Many
critics, especially the architects, have found fault with me for not "teaching people how to
arrange masses;" for not "attributing sufficient importance to composition." Alas! I attribute
far more importance to it than they do;--so much importance, that I should just as soon think
of sitting down to teach a man how to write a Divina Commedia, or King Lear, as how to "compose,"
in the true sense, a single building or picture. The marvellous stupidity of this age of lecturers
is, that they do not see that what they call "principles of composition," are mere principles
of common sense in everything, as well as in pictures and buildings;--A picture is to have
a principal light? Yes; and so a dinner is to have a principal dish, and an oration a principal
point, and an air of music a principal note, and every man a principal object. A picture is
to have harmony of relation among its parts? Yes; and so is a speech well uttered, and an action
well ordered, and a company well chosen, and a ragout well mixed. Composition! As if a man
were not composing every moment of his life, well or ill, and would not do it instinctively
in his picture as well as elsewhere, if he could. Composition of this lower or common kind
is of exactly the same importance in a picture that it is in any thing else,--no more. It is
well that a man should say what he has to say in good order and sequence, but the main thing
is to say it truly. And yet we go on preaching to our pupils as if to have a principal light
was every thing, and so cover our academy walls with Shacabac feasts, wherein the courses are
indeed well ordered, but the dishes empty.

It is not, however, only in invention that men over-work themselves, but in execution also;
and here I have a word to say to the Pre-Raphaelites specially. They are working too hard.
There is evidence in failing portions of their pictures, showing that they have wrought so
long upon them that their very sight has failed for weariness, and that the hand refused any
more to obey the heart. And, besides this, there are certain qualities of drawing which they
miss from over-carefulness. For, let them be assured, there is a great truth lurking in that
common desire of men to see things done in what they call a "masterly," or "bold," or "broad,"
manner: a truth oppressed and abused, like almost every other in this world, but an eternal
one nevertheless; and whatever mischief may have followed from men's looking for nothing else
but this facility of execution, and supposing that a picture was assuredly all right if only
it were done with broad dashes of the brush, still the truth remains the same:--that because
it is not intended that men shall torment or weary themselves with any earthly labor, it is
appointed that the noblest results should only be attainable by a certain ease and decision
of manipulation. I only wish people understood this much of sculpture, as well as of painting,
and could see that the finely finished statue is, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, a
far more vulgar work than that which shows rough signs of the right hand laid to the workman's
hammer: but at all events, in painting it is felt by all men, and justly felt. The freedom
of the lines of nature can only be represented by a similar freedom in the hand that follows
them; there are curves in the flow of the hair, and in the form of the features, and in the
muscular outline of the body, which can in no wise be caught but by a sympathetic freedom in
the stroke of the pencil. I do not care what example is taken, be it the most subtle and careful
work of Leonardo himself, there will be found a play and power and ease in the outlines, which
no slow effort could ever imitate. And if the Pre-Raphaelites do not understand how this kind
of power, in its highest perfection, may be united with the most severe rendering of all other
orders of truth, and especially of those with which they themselves have most sympathy, let
them look at the drawings of John Lewis.

These then are the principal lessons which we have to learn from Turner, in his second or central
period of labor. There is one more, however, to be received; and that is a warning; for towards
the close of it, what with doing small conventional vignettes for publishers, making showy
drawings from sketches taken by other people of places he had never seen, and touching up the
bad engravings from his works submitted to him almost every day,--engravings utterly destitute
of animation, and which had to be raised into a specious brilliancy by scratching them over
with white, spotty lights, he gradually got inured to many conventionalities, and even falsities;
and, having trusted for ten or twelve years almost entirely to his memory and invention, living
I believe mostly in London, and receiving a new sensation only from the burning of the Houses
of Parliament, he painted many pictures between 1830 and 1840 altogether unworthy of him. But
he was not thus to close his career.

In the summer either of 1840 or 1841, he undertook another journey into Switzerland. It was
then at least forty years since he had first seen the Alps; (the source of the Arveron, in
Mr. Fawkes's collection, which could not have been painted till he had seen the thing itself,
bears date 1800,) and the direction of his journey in 1840 marks his fond memory of that earliest
one; for, if we look over the Swiss studies and drawings executed in his first period, we shall
be struck with his fondness for the pass of the St. Gothard; the most elaborate drawing in
the Farnley collection is one of the Lake of Lucerne from Fluelen; and, counting the Liber
Studiorum subjects, there are, to my knowledge, six compositions taken at the same period from
the pass of St. Gothard, and, probably, several others are in existence. The valleys of Sallenche,
and Chamouni, and Lake of Geneva, are the only other Swiss scenes which seem to have made very
profound impressions on him.

He returned in 1841 to Lucerne; walked up Mont Pilate on foot, crossed the St. Gothard, and
returned by Lausanne and Geneva. He made a large number of colored sketches on this journey,
and realised several of them on his return. The drawings thus produced are different from all
that had preceded them, and are the first which belong definitely to what I shall henceforth
call his Third period.

The perfect repose of his youth had returned to his mind, while the faculties of imagination
and execution appeared in renewed strength; all conventionality being done away with by the
force of the impression which he had received from the Alps, after his long separation from
them. The drawings are marked by a peculiar largeness and simplicity of thought: most of them
by deep serenity, passing into melancholy; all by a richness of color, such as he had never
before conceived. They, and the works done in following years, bear the same relation to those
of the rest of his life that the colors of sunset do to those of the day; and will be recognised,
in a few years more, as the noblest landscapes ever yet conceived by human intellect.

Such has been the career of the greatest painter of this century. Many a century may pass away
before there rises such another; but what greatness any among us may be capable of, will, at
least, be best attained by following in his path; by beginning in all quietness and hopefulness
to use whatever powers we may possess to represent the things around us as we see and feel
them; trusting to the close of life to give the perfect crown to the course of its labors,
and knowing assuredly that the determination of the degree in which watchfulness is to be exalted
into invention, rests with a higher will than our own. And, if not greatness, at least a certain
good, is thus to be achieved; for though I have above spoken of the mission of the more humble
artist, as if it were merely to be subservient to that of the antiquarian or the man of science,
there is an ulterior aspect in which it is not subservient, but superior. Every archæologist,
every natural philosopher, knows that there is a peculiar rigidity of mind brought on by long
devotion to logical and analytical inquiries. Weak men, giving themselves to such studies,
are utterly hardened by them, and become incapable of understanding anything nobler, or even
of feeling the value of the results to which they lead. But even the best men are in a sort
injured by them, and pay a definite price, as in most other matters, for definite advantages.
They gain a peculiar strength, but lose in tenderness, elasticity, and impressibility. The
man who has gone, hammer in hand, over the surface of a romantic country, feels no longer,
in the mountain ranges he has so laboriously explored, the sublimity or mystery with which
they were veiled when he first beheld them, and with which they are adorned in the mind of
the passing traveller. In his more informed conception, they arrange themselves like a dissected
model: where another man would be awe-struck by the magnificence of the precipice, he sees
nothing but the emergence of a fossiliferous rock, familiarised already to his imagination
as extending in a shallow stratum, over a perhaps uninteresting district; where the unlearned
spectator would be touched with strong emotion by the aspect of the snowy summits which rise
in the distance, he sees only the culminating points of a metamorphic formation, with an uncomfortable
web of fan-like fissures radiating, in his imagination, through their centres[104]. That in
the grasp he has obtained of the inner relations of all these things to the universe, and to
man, that in the views which have been opened to him of natural energies such as no human mind
would have ventured to conceive, and of past states of being, each in some new way bearing
witness to the unity of purpose and everlastingly consistent providence of the Maker of all
things, he has received reward well worthy the sacrifice, I would not for an instant deny;
but the sense of the loss is not less painful to him if his mind be rightly constituted; and
it would be with infinite gratitude that he would regard the man, who, retaining in his delineation
of natural scenery a fidelity to the facts of science so rigid as to make his work at once
acceptable and credible to the most sternly critical intellect, should yet invest its features
again with the sweet veil of their daily aspect; should make them dazzling with the splendor
of wandering light, and involve them in the unsearchableness of stormy obscurity; should restore
to the divided anatomy its visible vitality of operation, clothe naked crags with soft forests,
enrich the mountain ruins with bright pastures, and lead the thoughts from the monotonous recurrence
of the phenomena of the physical world, to the sweet interests and sorrows of human life and death.

THE END.

FOOTNOTES:

[97] It was not a little curious, that in the very number of the Art Union which repeated this
direct falsehood about the Pre-Raphaelite rejection of "linear perspective" (by-the-bye, the
next time J. B. takes upon him to speak of any one connected with the Universities, he may
as well first ascertain the difference between a Graduate and an Under-Graduate), the second
plate given should have been of a picture of Bonington's,--a professional landscape painter,
observe,--for the want of aërial perspective in which the Art Union itself was obliged to apologise,
and in which the artist has committed nearly as many blunders in linear perspective as there
are lines in the picture.

[98] These false statements may be reduced to three principal heads, and directly contradicted
in succession.

The first, the current fallacy of society as well as of the press, was, that the Pre-Raphaelites
imitated the errors of early painters.

A falsehood of this kind could not have obtained credence anywhere but in England, few English
people, comparatively, having ever seen a picture of early Italian Masters. If they had, they
would have known that the Pre-Raphaelite pictures are just as superior to the early Italian
in skill of manipulation, power of drawing, and knowledge of effect, as inferior to them in
grace of design; and that in a word, there is not a shadow of resemblance between the two styles.
The Pre-Raphaelites imitate no pictures: they paint from nature only. But they have opposed
themselves as a body to that kind of teaching above described, which only began after Raphael's
time: and they have opposed themselves as sternly to the entire feeling of the Renaissance
schools; a feeling compounded of indolence, infidelity, sensuality, and shallow pride. Therefore
they have called themselves Pre-Raphaelites. If they adhere to their principles, and paint
nature as it is around them, with the help of modern science, with the earnestness of the men
of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, they will, as I said, found a new and noble school
in England. If their sympathies with the early artists lead them into mediævalism or Romanism,
they will of course come to nothing. But I believe there is no danger of this, at least for
the strongest among them. There may be some weak ones, whom the Tractarian heresies may touch;
but if so, they will drop off like decayed branches from a strong stem. I hope all things from
the school.

The second falsehood was, that the Pre-Raphaelites did not draw well. This was asserted, and
could have been asserted only by persons who had never looked at the pictures.

The third falsehood was, that they had no system of light and shade. To which it may be simply
replied that their system of light and shade is exactly the same as the Sun's; which is, I
believe, likely to outlast that of the Renaissance, however brilliant.

[99] He did not use his full signature, J. M. W., until about the year 1800.

[100] I shall give a catalogue raisonnée of all this in the third volume of "Modern Painters."

[101] The plate was, however, never published.

[102] And the more probably because Turner was never fond of staying long at any place, and
was least of all likely to make a pause of two or three days at the beginning of his journey.

[103] Vide Modern Painters, Part II. Sect. III. Chap. IV. § 14.

[104] This state of mind appears to have been the only one which Wordsworth had been able to
discern in men of science; and in disdain of which, he wrote that short-sighted passage in
the Excursion, Book III. l. 165-190, which is, I think, the only one in the whole range of
his works which his true friends would have desired to see blotted out. What else has been
found fault with as feeble or superfluous, is not so in the intense distinctive relief which
it gives to his character. But these lines are written in mere ignorance of the matter they
treat; in mere want of sympathy with the men they describe; for, observe, though the passage
is put into the mouth of the Solitary, it is fully confirmed, and even rendered more scornful,
by the speech which follows.

ARATRA PENTELICI

SIX LECTURES

ON THE ELEMENTS OF

SCULPTURE

GIVEN BEFORE THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD IN MICHAELMAS TERM, 1870

PREFACE.

I must pray the readers of the following Lectures to remember that the duty at present laid
on me at Oxford is of an exceptionally complex character. Directly, it is to awaken the interest
of my pupils in a study which they have hitherto found unattractive, and imagined to be useless;
but more imperatively, it is to define the principles by which the study itself should be guided;
and to vindicate their security against the doubts with which frequent discussion has lately
encumbered a subject which all think themselves competent to discuss. The possibility of such
vindication is, of course, implied in the original consent of the universities to the establishment
of Art Professorships. Nothing can be made an element of education of which it is impossible
to determine whether it is ill done or well; and the clear assertion that there is a canon
law in formative Art is, at this time, a more important function of each University than the
instruction of its younger members in any branch of practical skill. It matters comparatively
little whether few or many of our students learn to draw; but it matters much that all who
learn should be taught with accuracy. And the number who may be justifiably advised to give
any part of the time they spend at college to the study of painting or sculpture ought to depend,
and finally must depend, on their being certified that painting and sculpture, no less than
language or than reasoning, have grammar and method,--that they permit a recognizable distinction
between scholarship and ignorance, and enforce a constant distinction between Right and Wrong.

This opening course of Lectures on Sculpture is therefore restricted to the statement, not
only of first principles, but of those which were illustrated by the practice of one school,
and by that practice in its simplest branch, the analysis of which could be certified by easily
accessible examples, and aided by the indisputable evidence of photography.[105]

The exclusion of the terminal Lecture of the course from the series now published, is in order
to mark more definitely this limitation of my subject; but in other respects the Lectures have
been amplified in arranging them for the press, and the portions of them trusted at the time
to extempore delivery, (not through indolence, but because explanations of detail are always
most intelligible when most familiar,) have been in substance to the best of my power set down,
and in what I said too imperfectly, completed.

In one essential particular I have felt it necessary to write what I would not have spoken.
I had intended to make no reference, in my University Lectures, to existing schools of Art,
except in cases where it might be necessary to point out some undervalued excellence. The objects
specified in the eleventh paragraph of my inaugural Lecture, might, I hoped, have been accomplished
without reference to any works deserving of blame; but the Exhibition of the Royal Academy
in the present year showed me a necessity of departing from my original intention. The task
of impartial criticism[106] is now, unhappily, no longer to rescue modest skill from neglect;
but to withstand the errors of insolent genius, and abate the influence of plausible mediocrity.

The Exhibition of 1871 was very notable in this important particular, that it embraced some
representation of the modern schools of nearly every country in Europe; and I am well assured
that looking back upon it after the excitement of that singular interest has passed away, every
thoughtful judge of Art will confirm my assertion, that it contained not a single picture of
accomplished merit; while it contained many that were disgraceful to Art, and some that were
disgraceful to humanity.

It becomes, under such circumstances, my inevitable duty to speak of the existing conditions
of Art with plainness enough to guard the youths whose judgments I am entrusted to form, from
being misled, either by their own naturally vivid interest in what represents, however unworthily,
the scenes and persons of their own day, or by the cunningly devised, and, without doubt, powerful
allurements of Art which has long since confessed itself to have no other object than to allure.
I have, therefore, added to the second of these Lectures such illustration of the motives and
course of modern industry as naturally arose out of its subject, and shall continue in future
to make similar applications; rarely, indeed, permitting myself, in the Lectures actually read
before the University, to introduce subjects of instant, and therefore too exciting, interest;
but completing the addresses which I prepare for publication in these, and in any other particulars
which may render them more widely serviceable.

The present course of Lectures will be followed, if I am able to fulfil the design of them,
by one of a like elementary character on Architecture; and that by a third series on Christian
Sculpture: but, in the meantime, my effort is to direct the attention of the resident students
to Natural History, and to the higher branches of ideal Landscape: and it will be, I trust,
accepted as sufficient reason for the delay which has occurred in preparing the following sheets
for the press, that I have not only been interrupted by a dangerous illness, but engaged, in
what remained to me of the summer, in an endeavour to deduce, from the overwhelming complexity
of modern classification in the Natural Sciences, some forms capable of easier reference by
Art students, to whom the anatomy of brutal and floral nature is often no less important than
that of the human body.

The preparation of examples for manual practice, and the arrangement of standards for reference,
both in Painting and Sculpture, had to be carried on meanwhile, as I was able. For what has
already been done, the reader is referred to the Catalogue of the Educational Series, published
at the end of the Spring Term; of what remains to be done I will make no anticipatory statement,
being content to have ascribed to me rather the fault of narrowness in design, than of extravagance
in expectation.

    25th November, 1871.

FOOTNOTES:

[105] Photography cannot exhibit the character of large and finished sculpture; but its audacity
of shadow is in perfect harmony with the more roughly picturesque treatment necessary in coins.
For the rendering of all such frank relief, and for the better explanation of forms disturbed
by the lustre of metal or polished stone, the method employed in the plates of this volume
will be found, I believe, satisfactory. Casts are first taken from the coins, in white plaster;
these are photographed, and the photograph printed by the heliotype process of Messrs. Edwards
and Kidd. Plate XII. is exceptional, being a pure mezzotint engraving of the old school, excellently
carried through by my assistant, Mr. Allen, who was taught, as a personal favour to myself,
by my friend, and Turner's fellow-worker, Thomas Lupton. Plate IV. was intended to be a photograph
from the superb vase in the British Museum, No. 564 in Mr. Newton's Catalogue; but its variety
of colour defied photography, and after the sheets had gone to press I was compelled to reduce
Le Normand's plate of it, which is unsatisfactory, but answers my immediate purpose.

The enlarged photographs for use in the Lecture Room were made for me with most successful
skill by Sergeant Spackman, of South Kensington; and the help throughout rendered to me by
Mr. Burgess is acknowledged in the course of the Lectures; though with thanks which must remain
inadequate lest they should become tedious; for Mr. Burgess drew the subjects of Plates III.,
X., and XIII.; drew and engraved every woodcut in the book; and printed all the plates with
his own hand.

[106] A pamphlet by the Earl of Southesk, "Britain's Art Paradise," (Edmonston and Douglas,
Edinburgh) contains an entirely admirable criticism of the most faultful pictures of the 1871
Exhibition. It is to be regretted that Lord Southesk speaks only to condemn; but indeed, in
my own three days' review of the rooms, I found nothing deserving of notice otherwise, except
Mr. Hook's always pleasant sketches from fisher life, and Mr. Pettie's graceful and powerful,
though too slightly painted, study from Henry VI.

ARATRA PENTELICI.

LECTURE I.

OF THE DIVISION OF ARTS.

November, 1870.

1. If, as is commonly believed, the subject of study which it is my special function to bring
before you had no relation to the great interests of mankind, I should have less courage in
asking for your attention to-day, than when I first addressed you; though, even then, I did
not do so without painful diffidence. For at this moment, even supposing that in other places
it were possible for men to pursue their ordinary avocations undisturbed by indignation or
pity; here, at least, in the midst of the deliberative and religious influences of England,
only one subject, I am well assured, can seriously occupy your thoughts--the necessity, namely,
of determining how it has come to pass, that in these recent days, iniquity the most reckless
and monstrous can be committed unanimously, by men more generous than ever yet in the world's
history were deceived into deeds of cruelty; and that prolonged agony of body and spirit, such
as we should shrink from inflicting wilfully on a single criminal, has become the appointed
and accepted portion of unnumbered multitudes of innocent persons, inhabiting the districts
of the world which, of all others, as it seemed, were best instructed in the laws of civilization,
and most richly invested with the honour, and indulged in the felicity, of peace.

Believe me, however, the subject of Art--instead of being foreign to these deep questions of
social duty and peril,--is so vitally connected with them, that it would be impossible for
me now to pursue the line of thought in which I began these lectures, because so ghastly an
emphasis would be given to every sentence by the force of passing events. It is well, then,
that in the plan I have laid down for your study, we shall now be led into the examination
of technical details, or abstract conditions of sentiment; so that the hours you spend with
me may be times of repose from heavier thoughts. But it chances strangely that, in this course
of minutely detailed study, I have first to set before you the most essential piece of human
workmanship, the plough, at the very moment when--(you may see the announcement in the journals
either of yesterday or the day before)--the swords of your soldiers have been sent for to be
sharpened, and not at all to be beaten into ploughshares. I permit myself, therefore, to remind
you of the watchword of all my earnest writings--"Soldiers of the Ploughshare, instead of Soldiers
of the Sword"--and I know it my duty to assert to you that the work we enter upon to-day is
no trivial one, but full of solemn hope; the hope, namely, that among you there may be found
men wise enough to lead the national passions towards the arts of peace, instead of the arts
of war.

I say the work "we enter upon," because the first four lectures I gave in the spring were wholly
prefatory; and the following three only defined for you methods of practice. To-day we begin
the systematic analysis and progressive study of our subject.

2. In general, the three great, or fine, Arts of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, are
thought of as distinct from the lower and more mechanical formative arts, such as carpentry
or pottery. But we cannot, either verbally, or with any practical advantage, admit such classification.
How are we to distinguish painting on canvas from painting on china?--or painting on china
from painting on glass?--or painting on glass from infusion of colour into any vitreous substance,
such as enamel?--or the infusion of colour into glass and enamel from the infusion of colour
into wool or silk, and weaving of pictures in tapestry, or patterns in dress? You will find
that although, in ultimately accurate use of the word, painting must be held to mean only the
laying of a pigment on a surface with a soft instrument; yet, in broad comparison of the functions
of Art, we must conceive of one and the same great artistic faculty, as governing every mode
of disposing colours in a permanent relation on, or in, a solid substance; whether it be by
tinting canvas, or dyeing stuffs; inlaying metals with fused flint, or coating walls with coloured
stone.

3. Similarly the word "Sculpture,"--though in ultimate accuracy it is to be limited to the
development of form in hard substances by cutting away portions of their mass--in broad definition,
must be held to signify the reduction of any shapeless mass of solid matter into an intended
shape, whatever the consistence of the substance, or nature of the instrument employed; whether
we carve a granite mountain, or a piece of box-wood, and whether we use, for our forming instrument
axe, or hammer, or chisel, or our own hands, or water to soften, or fire to fuse;--whenever
and however we bring a shapeless thing into shape, we do so under the laws of the one great
Art of Sculpture.

4. Having thus broadly defined painting and sculpture, we shall see that there is, in the third
place, a class of work separated from both, in a specific manner, and including a great group
of arts which neither, of necessity, tint, nor for the sake of form merely, shape, the substances
they deal with; but construct or arrange them with a view to the resistance of some external
force. We construct, for instance, a table with a flat top, and some support of prop, or leg,
proportioned in strength to such weights as the table is intended to carry. We construct a
ship out of planks, or plates of iron, with reference to certain forces of impact to be sustained,
and of inertia to be overcome; or we construct a wall or roof with distinct reference to forces
of pressure and oscillation, to be sustained or guarded against; and therefore, in every case,
with especial consideration of the strength of our materials, and the nature of that strength,
elastic, tenacious, brittle, and the like.

Now although this group of arts nearly always involves the putting of two or more separate
pieces together, we must not define it by that accident. The blade of an oar is not less formed
with reference to external force than if it were made of many pieces; and the frame of a boat,
whether hollowed out of a tree-trunk, or constructed of planks nailed together, is essentially
the same piece of art; to be judged by its buoyancy and capacity of progression. Still, from
the most wonderful piece of all architecture, the human skeleton, to this simple one,[107]
the ploughshare, on which it depends for its subsistence, the putting of two or more pieces
together is curiously necessary to the perfectness of every fine instrument; and the peculiar
mechanical work of Dædalus,--inlaying,--becomes all the more delightful to us in external aspect,
because, as in the jawbone of a Saurian, or the wood of a bow, it is essential to the finest
capacities of tension and resistance.

5. And observe how unbroken the ascent from this, the simplest architecture, to the loftiest.
The placing of the timbers in a ship's stem, and the laying of the stones in a bridge buttress,
are similar in art to the construction of the ploughshare, differing in no essential point,
either in that they deal with other materials, or because, of the three things produced, one
has to divide earth by advancing through it, another to divide water by advancing through it,
and the third to divide water which advances against it. And again, the buttress of a bridge
differs only from that of a cathedral in having less weight to sustain, and more to resist.
We can find no term in the gradation, from the ploughshare to the cathedral buttress, at which
we can set a logical distinction.

6. Thus then we have simply three divisions of Art--one, that of giving colours to substance;
another, that of giving form to it without question of resistance to force; and the third,
that of giving form or position which will make it capable of such resistance. All the fine
arts are embraced under these three divisions. Do not think that it is only a logical or scientific
affectation to mass them together in this manner; it is, on the contrary, of the first practical
importance to understand that the painter's faculty, or masterhood over colour, being as subtle
as a musician's over sound, must be looked to for the government of every operation in which
colour is employed; and that, in the same manner, the appliance of any art whatsoever to minor
objects cannot be right, unless under the direction of a true master of that art. Under the
present system, you keep your Academician occupied only in producing tinted pieces of canvas
to be shown in frames, and smooth pieces of marble to be placed in niches; while you expect
your builder or constructor to design coloured patterns in stone and brick, and your china-ware
merchant to keep a separate body of workwomen who can paint china, but nothing else. By this
division of labour, you ruin all the arts at once. The work of the Academician becomes mean
and effeminate, because he is not used to treat colour on a grand scale and in rough materials;
and your manufactures become base because no well educated person sets hand to them. And therefore
it is necessary to understand, not merely as a logical statement, but as a practical necessity,
that wherever beautiful colour is to be arranged, you need a Master of Painting; and wherever
noble form is to be given, a Master of Sculpture; and wherever complex mechanical force is
to be resisted, a Master of Architecture.

7. But over this triple division there must rule another yet more important. Any of these three
arts may be either imitative of natural objects or limited to useful appliance. You may either
paint a picture that represents a scene, or your street door, to keep it from rotting; you
may mould a statue, or a plate; build the resemblance of a cluster of lotus stalks, or only
a square pier. Generally speaking, Painting and Sculpture will be imitative, and Architecture
merely useful; but there is a great deal of Sculpture--as this crystal ball[108] for instance,
which is not imitative, and a great deal of Architecture which, to some extent is so, as the
so called foils of Gothic apertures; and for many other reasons you will find it necessary
to keep distinction clear in your minds between the arts--of whatever kind--which are imitative,
and produce a resemblance or image of something which is not present; and those which are limited
to the production of some useful reality, as the blade of a knife, or the wall of a house.
You will perceive also, as we advance, that sculpture and painting are indeed in this respect
only one art; and that we shall have constantly to speak and think of them as simply graphic,
whether with chisel or colour, their principal function being to make us, in the words of Aristotle,
"[Greek: theôrêtikoi tou peri ta sômata kallous]" (Polit. 8, 3.), "having capacity and habit
of contemplation of the beauty that is in material things;" while Architecture, and its co-relative
arts, are to be practised under quite other conditions of sentiment.

8. Now it is obvious that so far as the fine arts consist either in imitation or mechanical
construction, the right judgment of them must depend on our knowledge of the things they imitate,
and forces they resist: and my function of teaching here would (for instance) so far resolve
itself, either into demonstration that this painting of a peach,[109] does resemble a peach,
or explanation of the way in which this ploughshare (for instance) is shaped so as to throw
the earth aside with least force of thrust. And in both of these methods of study, though of
course your own diligence must be your chief master, to a certain extent your Professor of
Art can always guide you securely, and can show you, either that the image does truly resemble
what it attempts to resemble, or that the structure is rightly prepared for the service it
has to perform. But there is yet another virtue of fine art which is, perhaps, exactly that
about which you will expect your Professor to teach you most, and which, on the contrary, is
exactly that about which you must teach yourselves all that it is essential to learn.

9. I have here in my hand one of the simplest possible examples of the union of the graphic
and constructive powers,--one of my breakfast plates. Since all the finely architectural arts,
we said, began in the shaping of the cup and the platter, we will begin, ourselves, with the
platter.

Why has it been made round? For two structural reasons: first, that the greatest holding surface
may be gathered into the smallest space; and secondly, that in being pushed past other things
on the table, it may come into least contact with them.

Next, why has it a rim? For two other structural reasons; first, that it is convenient to put
salt or mustard upon; but secondly and chiefly, that the plate may be easily laid hold of.
The rim is the simplest form of continuous handle.

Farther, to keep it from soiling the cloth, it will be wise to put this ridge beneath, round
the bottom; for as the rim is the simplest possible form of continuous handle, so this is the
simplest form of continuous leg. And we get the section given beneath the figure for the essential
one of a rightly made platter.

10. Thus far our art has been strictly utilitarian having respect to conditions of collision,
of carriage, and of support. But now, on the surface of our piece of pottery, here are various
bands and spots of colour which are presumably set there to make it pleasanter to the eye.
Six of the spots, seen closely, you discover are intended to represent flowers. These then
have as distinctly a graphic purpose as the other properties of the plate have an architectural
one, and the first critical question we have to ask about them is, whether they are like roses
or not. I will anticipate what I have to say in subsequent lectures so far as to assure you
that, if they are to be like roses at all, the liker they can be, the better. Do not suppose,
as many people will tell you, that because this is a common manufactured article, your roses
on it are the better for being ill-painted, or half-painted. If they had been painted by the
same hand that did this peach, the plate would have been all the better for it; but, as it
chanced, there was no hand such as William Hunt's to paint them, and their graphic power is
not distinguished. In any case, however, that graphic power must have been subordinate to their
effect as pink spots, while the band of green-blue round the plate's edge, and the spots of
gold, pretend to no graphic power at all, but are meaningless spaces of colour or metal. Still
less have they any mechanical office: they add nowise to the serviceableness of the plate;
and their agreeableness, if they possess any, depends, therefore, neither on any imitative,
nor any structural, character; but on some inherent pleasantness in themselves, either of mere
colours to the eye (as of taste to the tongue), or in the placing of those colours in relations
which obey some mental principle of order, or physical principle of harmony.

11. These abstract relations and inherent pleasantnesses, whether in space, number, or time,
and whether of colours or sounds, form what we may properly term the musical or harmonic element
in every art; and the study of them is an entirely separate science. It is the branch of art-philosophy
to which the word "æsthetics" should be strictly limited, being the inquiry into the nature
of things that in themselves are pleasant to the human senses or instincts, though they represent
nothing, and serve for nothing, their only service being their pleasantness. Thus it is the
province of æsthetics to tell you, (if you did not know it before,) that the taste and colour
of a peach are pleasant, and to ascertain, if it be ascertainable, (and you have any curiosity
to know,) why they are so.

12. The information would, I presume, to most of you, be gratuitous. If it were not, and you
chanced to be in a sick state of body in which you disliked peaches, it would be, for the time,
to you false information, and, so far as it was true of other people, to you useless. Nearly
the whole study of æsthetics is in like manner either gratuitous or useless. Either you like
the right things without being recommended to do so, or if you dislike them, your mind cannot
be changed by lectures on the laws of taste. You recollect the story of Thackeray, provoked,
as he was helping himself to strawberries, by a young coxcomb's telling him that "he never
took fruit or sweets." "That" replied, or is said to have replied, Thackeray, "is because you
are a sot, and a glutton." And the whole science of æsthetics is, in the depth of it, expressed
by one passage of Goethe's in the end of the 2nd part of Faust;--the notable one that follows
the song of the Lemures, when the angels enter to dispute with the fiends for the soul of Faust.
They enter singing--"Pardon to sinners and life to the dust." Mephistopheles hears them first,
and exclaims to his troop, "Discord I hear, and filthy jingling"--"Mistöne höre ich; garstiges
Geklimper." This, you see, is the extreme of bad taste in music. Presently the angelic host
begin strewing roses, which discomfits the diabolic crowd altogether. Mephistopheles in vain
calls to them--"What do you duck and shrink for--is that proper hellish behaviour? Stand fast,
and let them strew"--"Was duckt und zuckt ihr; ist das Hellen-brauch? So haltet stand, und
lasst sie streuen." There you have, also, the extreme of bad taste in sight and smell. And
in the whole passage is a brief embodiment for you of the ultimate fact that all æsthetics
depend on the health of soul and body, and the proper exercise of both, not only through years,
but generations. Only by harmony of both collateral and successive lives can the great doctrine
of the Muses be received which enables men "[Greek: chairein orthôs]," "to have pleasures rightly;"
and there is no other definition of the beautiful, nor of any subject of delight to the æsthetic
faculty, than that it is what one noble spirit has created, seen and felt by another of similar
or equal nobility. So much as there is in you of ox, or of swine, perceives no beauty, and
creates none: what is human in you, in exact proportion to the perfectness of its humanity,
can create it, and receive.

13. Returning now to the very elementary form in which the appeal to our æsthetic virtue is
made in our breakfast-plate, you notice that there are two distinct kinds of pleasantness attempted.
One by hues of colour; the other by proportions of space. I have called these the musical elements
of the arts relating to sight; and there are indeed two complete sciences, one of the combinations
of colour, and the other of the combinations of line and form, which might each of them separately
engage us in as intricate study as that of the science of music. But of the two, the science
of colour is, in the Greek sense, the more musical, being one of the divisions of the Apolline
power; and it is so practically educational, that if we are not using the faculty for colour
to discipline nations, they will infallibly use it themselves as a means of corruption. Both
music and colour are naturally influences of peace; but in the war trumpet, and the war shield,
in the battle song and battle standard, they have concentrated by beautiful imagination the
cruel passions of men; and there is nothing in all the Divina Commedia of history more grotesque,
yet more frightful, than the fact that, from the almost fabulous period when the insanity and
impiety of war wrote themselves in the symbols of the shields of the Seven against Thebes,
colours have been the sign and stimulus of the most furious and fatal passions that have rent
the nations: blue against green, in the decline of the Roman Empire; black against white, in
that of Florence; red against white, in the wars of the Royal houses in England; and at this
moment, red against white, in the contest of anarchy and loyalty, in all the world.

14. On the other hand, the directly ethical influence of colour in the sky, the trees, flowers,
and coloured creatures round us, and in our own various arts massed under the one name of painting,
is so essential and constant that we cease to recognize it, because we are never long enough
altogether deprived of it to feel our need; and the mental diseases induced by the influence
of corrupt colour are as little suspected, or traced to their true source, as the bodily weaknesses
resulting from atmospheric miasmata.

15. The second musical science which belongs peculiarly to sculpture (and to painting, so far
as it represents form), consists in the disposition of beautiful masses. That is to say, beautiful
surfaces limited by beautiful lines. Beautiful surfaces, observe; and remember what is noted
in my fourth lecture of the difference between a space and a mass. If you have at any time
examined carefully, or practised from, the drawings of shells placed in your copying series,
you cannot but have felt the difference in the grace between the aspects of the same line,
when enclosing a rounded or unrounded space. The exact science of sculpture is that of the
relations between outline and the solid form it limits; and it does not matter whether that
relation be indicated by drawing or carving, so long as the expression of solid form is the
mental purpose; it is the science always of the beauty of relation in three dimensions. To
take the simplest possible line of continuous limit--the circle: the flat disc enclosed by
it may indeed be made an element of decoration, though a very meagre one but its relative mass,
the ball, being gradated in three dimensions, is always delightful. Here[110] is at once the
simplest, and in mere patient mechanism, the most skilful, piece of sculpture I can possibly
show you,--a piece of the purest rock-crystal, chiselled, (I believe, by mere toil of hand,)
into a perfect sphere. Imitating nothing, constructing nothing; sculpture for sculpture's sake,
of purest natural substance into simplest primary form.

16. Again. Out of the nacre of any mussel or oyster-shell you might cut, at your pleasure,
any quantity of small flat circular discs of the prettiest colour and lustre. To some extent,
such tinsel or foil of shell is used pleasantly for decoration. But the mussel or oyster becoming
itself an unwilling modeller, agglutinates its juice into three dimensions, and the fact of
the surface being now geometrically gradated, together with the savage instinct of attributing
value to what is difficult to obtain, make the little boss so precious in men's sight that
wise eagerness of search for the kingdom of heaven can be likened to their eagerness of search
for it; and the gates of Paradise can be no otherwise rendered so fair to their poor intelligence,
as by telling them that every several gate was of "one pearl."

17. But take note here. We have just seen that the sum of the perceptive faculty is expressed
in those words of Aristotle's "to take pleasure rightly" or straightly--[Greek: chairein orthôs].
Now, it is not possible to do the direct opposite of that,--to take pleasure iniquitously or
obliquely--[Greek: chairein adikôs] or [Greek: skoliôs]--more than you do in enjoying a thing
because your neighbour cannot get it. You may enjoy a thing legitimately because it is rare,
and cannot be seen often, (as you do a fine aurora, or a sunset, or an unusually lovely flower);
that is Nature's way of stimulating your attention. But if you enjoy it because your neighbour
cannot have it--and, remember, all value attached to pearls more than glass beads, is merely
and purely for that cause,--then you rejoice through the worst of idolatries, covetousness;
and neither arithmetic, nor writing, nor any other so-called essential of education, is now
so vitally necessary to the population of Europe, as such acquaintance with the principles
of intrinsic value, as may result in the iconoclasm of jewellery; and in the clear understanding
that we are not in that instinct, civilized, but yet remain wholly savage, so far as we care
for display of this selfish kind.

You think, perhaps, I am quitting my subject, and proceeding, as it is too often with appearance
of justice alleged against me, into irrelevant matter. Pardon me; the end, not only of these
lectures, but of my whole professorship, would be accomplished,--and far more than that,--if
only the English nation could be made to understand that the beauty which is indeed to be a
joy for ever, must be a joy for all; and that though the idolatry may not have been wholly
divine which sculptured gods, the idolatry is wholly diabolic, which, for vulgar display, sculptures
diamonds.

18. To go back to the point under discussion. A pearl, or a glass bead, may owe its pleasantness
in some degree to its lustre as well as to its roundness. But a mere and simple ball of unpolished
stone is enough for sculpturesque value. You may have noticed that the quatrefoil used in the
Ducal Palace of Venice owes its complete loveliness in distant effect to the finishing of its
cusps. The extremity of the cusp is a mere ball of Istrian marble; and consider how subtle
the faculty of sight must be, since it recognizes at any distance, and is gratified by, the
mystery of the termination of cusp obtained by the gradated light on the ball.

In that Venetian tracery this simplest element of sculptured form is used sparingly, as the
most precious that can be employed to finish the façade. But alike in our own, and the French,
central Gothic, the ball-flower is lavished on every line--and in your St. Mary's spire, and
the Salisbury spire, and the towers of Notre Dame of Paris, the rich pleasantness of decoration,--indeed,
their so-called "decorated style,"--consists only in being daintily beset with stone balls.
It is true the balls are modified into dim likeness of flowers; but do you trace the resemblance
to the rose in their distant, which is their intended effect?

19. But farther, let the ball have motion; then the form it generates will be that of a cylinder.
You have, perhaps, thought that pure Early English Architecture depended for its charm on visibility
of construction. It depends for its charm altogether on the abstract harmony of groups of cylinders,[111]
arbitrarily bent into mouldings, and arbitrarily associated as shafts, having no real relation
to construction whatsoever, and a theoretical relation so subtle that none of us had seen it,
till Professor Willis worked it out for us.

20. And now, proceeding to analysis of higher sculpture, you may have observed the importance
I have attached to the porch of San Zenone, at Verona, by making it, among your standards,
the first of the group which is to illustrate the system of sculpture and architecture founded
on faith in a future life. That porch, fortunately represented in the photograph, from which
Plate I. has been engraved, under a clear and pleasant light, furnishes you with examples of
sculpture of every kind from the flattest incised bas-relief to solid statues, both in marble
and bronze. And the two points I have been pressing upon you are conclusively exhibited here,
namely,--(1). That sculpture is essentially the production of a pleasant bossiness or roundness
of surface; (2) that the pleasantness of that bossy condition to the eye is irrespective of
imitation on one side, and of structure on the other.

21.

If you look from some distance at these two engravings of Greek coins, (place the book open
so that you can see the opposite plate three or four yards off,) you will find the relief on
each of them simplifies itself into a pearl-like portion of a sphere, with exquisitely gradated
light on its surface. When you look at them nearer, you will see that each smaller portion
into which they are divided--cheek, or brow, or leaf, or tress of hair--resolves itself also
into a rounded or undulated surface, pleasant by gradation of light. Every several surface
is delightful in itself, as a shell, or a tuft of rounded moss, or the bossy masses of distant
forest would be. That these intricately modulated masses present some resemblance to a girl's
face, such as the Syracusans imagined that of the water-goddess Arethusa, is entirely a secondary
matter; the primary condition is that the masses shall be beautifully rounded, and disposed
with due discretion and order.

22. (2.) It is difficult for you, at first, to feel this order and beauty of surface, apart
from the imitation. But you can see there is a pretty disposition of, and relation between,
the projections of a fir-cone, though the studded spiral imitates nothing. Order exactly the
same in kind, only much more complex; and an abstract beauty of surface rendered definite by
increase and decline of light--(for every curve of surface has its own luminous law, and the
light and shade on a parabolic solid differs, specifically, from that on an elliptical or spherical
one)--it is the essential business of the sculptor to obtain; as it is the essential business
of a painter to get good colour, whether he imitates anything or not. At a distance from the
picture, or carving, where the things represented become absolutely unintelligible, we must
yet be able to say, at a glance, "That is good painting, or good carving."

And you will be surprised to find, when you try the experiment, how much the eye must instinctively
judge in this manner. Take the front of San Zenone for instance, Plate I. You will find it
impossible without a lens, to distinguish in the bronze gates, and in great part of the wall,
anything that their bosses represent. You cannot tell whether the sculpture is of men, animals,
or trees; only you feel it to be composed of pleasant projecting masses; you acknowledge that
both gates and wall are, somehow, delightfully roughened; and only afterwards, by slow degrees,
can you make out what this roughness means; nay, though here (Plate III.) I magnify[112] one
of the bronze plates of the gate to a scale, which gives you the same advantage as if you saw
it quite close, in the reality,--you may still be obliged to me for the information, that this
boss represents the Madonna asleep in her little bed, and this smaller boss, the Infant Christ
in His; and this at the top, a cloud with an angel coming out of it, and these jagged bosses,
two of the Three Kings, with their crowns on, looking up to the star, (which is intelligible
enough I admit); but what this straggling, three-legged boss beneath signifies, I suppose neither
you nor I can tell, unless it be the shepherd's dog, who has come suddenly upon the Kings with
their crowns on, and is greatly startled at them.

23. Farther, and much more definitely, the pleasantness of the surface decoration is independent
of structure; that is to say, of any architectural requirement of stability. The greater part
of the sculpture here is exclusively ornamentation of a flat wall, or of door panelling; only
a small portion of the church front is thus treated, and the sculpture has no more to do with
the form of the building than a piece of a lace veil would have, suspended beside its gates
on a festal day; the proportions of shaft and arch might be altered in a hundred different
ways, without diminishing their stability; and the pillars would stand more safely on the ground
than on the backs of these carved animals.

24. I wish you especially to notice these points, because the false theory that ornamentation
should be merely decorated structure is so pretty and plausible, that it is likely to take
away your attention from the far more important abstract conditions of design. Structure should
never be contradicted, and in the best buildings it is pleasantly exhibited and enforced; in
this very porch the joints of every stone are visible, and you will find me in the Fifth Lecture
insisting on this clearness of its anatomy as a merit; yet so independent is the mechanical
structure of the true design, that when I begin my Lectures on Architecture, the first building
I shall give you as a standard will be one in which the structure is wholly concealed. It will
be the Baptistry of Florence, which is, in reality, as much a buttressed chapel with a vaulted
roof, as the Chapter House of York--but round it, in order to conceal that buttressed structure,
(not to decorate, observe, but to conceal) a flat external wall is raised; simplifying the
whole to a mere hexagonal box, like a wooden piece of Tunbridge ware, on the surface of which
the eye and intellect are to be interested by the relations of dimension and curve between
pieces of encrusting marble of different colours, which have no more to do with the real make
of the building than the diaper of a Harlequin's jacket has to do with his bones.

25. The sense of abstract proportion, on which the enjoyment of such a piece of art entirely
depends, is one of the æsthetic faculties which nothing can develop but time and education.
It belongs only to highly-trained nations; and, among them, to their most strictly refined
classes, though the germs of it are found, as part of their innate power, in every people capable
of art. It has for the most part vanished at present from the English mind, in consequence
of our eager desire for excitement, and for the kind of splendour that exhibits wealth, careless
of dignity; so that, I suppose, there are very few now even of our best-trained Londoners who
know the difference between the design of Whitehall and that of any modern club-house in Pall-mall.
The order and harmony which, in his enthusiastic account of the Theatre of Epidaurus, Pausanias
insists on before beauty, can only be recognized by stern order and harmony in our daily lives;
and the perception of them is as little to be compelled, or taught suddenly, as the laws of
still finer choice in the conception of dramatic incident which regulate poetic sculpture.

26. And now, at last, I think, we can sketch out the subject before us in a clear light. We
have a structural art, divine, and human, of which the investigation comes under the general
term, Anatomy; whether the junctions or joints be in mountains, or in branches of trees, or
in buildings, or in bones of animals. We have next a musical art, falling into two distinct
divisions--one using colours, the other masses, for its elements of composition; lastly, we
have an imitative art, concerned with the representation of the outward appearances of things.
And, for many reasons, I think it best to begin with imitative Sculpture; that being defined
as the art which, by the musical disposition of masses, imitates anything of which the imitation
is justly pleasant to us; and does so in accordance with structural laws having due reference
to the materials employed.

So that you see our task will involve the immediate inquiry what the things are of which the
imitation is justly pleasant to us: what, in few words,--if we are to be occupied in the making
of graven images--we ought to like to make images of. Secondly, after having determined its
subject, what degree of imitation or likeness we ought to desire in our graven image; and lastly,
under what limitations demanded by structure and material, such likeness may be obtained.

These inquiries I shall endeavour to pursue with you to some practical conclusion, in my next
four lectures, and in the sixth, I will briefly sketch the actual facts that have taken place
in the development of sculpture by the two greatest schools of it that hitherto have existed
in the world.

27. The tenor of our next lecture then must be an inquiry into the real nature of Idolatry;
that is to say, the invention and service of Idols: and, in the interval, may I commend to
your own thoughts this question, not wholly irrelevant, yet which I cannot pursue; namely,
whether the God to whom we have so habitually prayed for deliverance "from battle, murder,
and sudden death," is indeed, seeing that the present state of Christendom is the result of
a thousand years' praying to that effect, "as the gods of the heathen who were but idols;"
or whether--(and observe, one or other of these things must be true)--whether our prayers to
Him have been, by this much, worse than Idolatry;--that heathen prayer was true prayer to false
gods; and our prayers have been false prayers to the True One.

FOOTNOTES:

[107] I had a real ploughshare on my lecture table; but it would interrupt the drift of the
statements in the text too long if I attempted here to illustrate by figures the relation of
the coulter to the share, and of the hard to the soft pieces of metal in the share itself.

[111] All grandest effects in mouldings may be, and for the most part have been, obtained by
rolls and cavettos of circular (segmental) section. More refined sections, as that of the fluting
of a Doric shaft, are only of use near the eye and in beautiful stone; and the pursuit of them
was one of the many errors of later Gothic. The statement in the text that the mouldings, even
of best time, "have no real relation to construction," is scarcely strong enough: they in fact
contend with, and deny the construction, their principal purpose seeming to be the concealment
of the joints of the voussoirs.

[112] Some of the most precious work done for me by my assistant Mr. Burgess, during the course
of these lectures, consisted in making enlarged drawings from portions of photographs. Plate

LECTURE II.

IDOLATRY.

November, 1870.

28. Beginning with the simple conception of sculpture as the art of fiction in solid substance,
we are now to consider what its subjects should be. What--having the gift of imagery--should
we by preference endeavour to image? A question which is, indeed, subordinate to the deeper
one--why we should wish to image anything at all.

29. Some years ago, having been always desirous that the education of women should begin in
learning how to cook, I got leave, one day, for a little girl of eleven years old to exchange,
much to her satisfaction, her schoolroom for the kitchen. But as ill fortune would have it,
there was some pastry toward, and she was left unadvisedly in command of some delicately rolled
paste; whereof she made no pies, but an unlimited quantity of cats and mice.

Now you may read the works of the gravest critics of art from end to end; but you will find,
at last, they can give you no other true account of the spirit of sculpture than that it is
an irresistible human instinct for the making of cats and mice, and other imitable living creatures,
in such permanent form that one may play with the images at leisure.

Play with them, or love them, or fear them, or worship them. The cat may become the goddess
Pasht, and the mouse, in the hand of the sculptured king, enforce his enduring words "[Greek:
es eme tis oreôn eusebês estô];" but the great mimetic instinct underlies all such purpose;
and is zooplastic,--life-shaping,--alike in the reverent and the impious.

30. Is, I say, and has been, hitherto; none of us dare say that it will be. I shall have to
show you hereafter that the greater part of the technic energy of men, as yet, has indicated
a kind of childhood; and that the race becomes, if not more wise, at least more manly,[113]
with every gained century. I can fancy that all this sculpturing and painting of ours may be
looked back upon, in some distant time, as a kind of doll-making, and that the words of Sir
Isaac Newton may be smiled at no more: only it will not be for stars that we desert our stone
dolls, but for men. When the day comes, as come it must, in which we no more deface and defile
God's image in living clay, I am not sure that we shall any of us care so much for the images
made of Him, in burnt clay.

31. But, hitherto, the energy of growth in any people may be almost directly measured by their
passion for imitative art; namely, for sculpture, or for the drama, which is living and speaking
sculpture, or, as in Greece, for both; and in national as in actual childhood, it is not merely
the making, but the making-believe; not merely the acting for the sake of the scene, but acting
for the sake of acting, that is delightful. And, of the two mimetic arts, the drama, being
more passionate, and involving conditions of greater excitement and luxury, is usually in its
excellence the sign of culminating strength in the people; while fine sculpture, requiring
always submission to severe law, is an unfailing proof of their being in early and active progress.
There is no instance of fine sculpture being produced by a nation either torpid, weak, or in
decadence. Their drama may gain in grace and wit; but their sculpture, in days of decline,
is always base.

32. If my little lady in the kitchen had been put in command of colours, as well as of dough,
and if the paste would have taken the colours, we may be sure her mice would have been painted
brown, and her cats tortoise-shell; and this, partly indeed for the added delight and prettiness
of colour itself, but more for the sake of absolute realization to her eyes and mind. Now all
the early sculpture of the most accomplished nations has been thus coloured, rudely or finely;
and, therefore, you see at once how necessary it is that we should keep the term "graphic"
for imitative art generally; since no separation can at first be made between carving and painting,
with reference to the mental powers exerted in, or addressed by, them. In the earliest known
art of the world, a reindeer hunt may be scratched in outline on the flat side of a clean-picked
bone, and a reindeer's head carved out of the end of it; both these are flint-knife work, and,
strictly speaking, sculpture: but the scratched outline is the beginning of drawing, and the
carved head of sculpture proper. When the spaces enclosed by the scratched outline are filled
with colour, the colouring soon becomes a principal means of effect; so that, in the engraving
of an Egyptian-colour bas-relief (S. 101), Rosellini has been content to miss the outlining
incisions altogether, and represent it as a painting only. Its proper definition is, "painting
accented by sculpture;" on the other hand, in solid coloured statues,--Dresden china figures,
for example,--we have pretty sculpture accented by painting; the mental purpose in both kinds
of art being to obtain the utmost degree of realization possible, and the ocular impression
being the same, whether the delineation is obtained by engraving or painting. For, as I pointed
out to you in my fifth lecture, everything is seen by the eye as patches of colour, and of
colour only; a fact which the Greeks knew well; so that when it becomes a question in the dialogue
of Minos, "[Greek: tini onti tê opsei horatai ta hoômena]," the answer is "[Greek: aisthêsei
tautê tê dia tôn ophthalmôn dêloisê hêmin ta chrômata]."--"What kind of power is the sight
with which we see things? It is that sense which, through the eyes, can reveal colours to us."

33. And now observe that while the graphic arts begin in the mere mimetic effort, they proceed,
as they obtain more perfect realization, to act under the influence of a stronger and higher
instinct. They begin by scratching the reindeer, the most interesting object of sight. But
presently, as the human creature rises in scale of intellect, it proceeds to scratch, not the
most interesting object of sight only, but the most interesting object of imagination; not
the reindeer, but the Maker and Giver of the reindeer. And the second great condition for the
advance of the art of sculpture is that the race should possess, in addition to the mimetic
instinct, the realistic or idolizing instinct; the desire to see as substantial the powers
that are unseen, and bring near those that are far off, and to possess and cherish those that
are strange. To make in some way tangible and visible the nature of the gods--to illustrate
and explain it by symbols; to bring the immortals out of the recesses of the clouds, and make
them Penates; to bring back the dead from darkness, and make them Lares.

34. Our conception of this tremendous and universal human passion has been altogether narrowed
by the current idea that Pagan religious art consisted only, or chiefly, in giving personality
to the gods. The personality was never doubted; it was visibility, interpretation, and possession
that the hearts of men sought. Possession, first of all--the getting hold of some hewn log
of wild olive-wood that would fall on its knees if it was pulled from its pedestal--and, afterwards,
slowly clearing manifestation; the exactly right expression is used in Lucian's dream,--[Greek:
Pheidias edeixe ton Dia]; "Showed[114] Zeus;" manifested him, nay, in a certain sense, brought
forth, or created, as you have it, in Anacreon's ode to the Rose, of the birth of Athena herself--

    [Greek: polemoklonon t' Athênên
    koruphês edeiknye Zeus.]

But I will translate the passage from Lucian to you at length--it is in every way profitable.

35. "There came to me, in the healing[115] night, a divine dream, so clear that it missed nothing
of the truth itself; yes, and still after all this time, the shapes of what I saw remain in
my sight, and the sound of what I heard dwells in my ears"--note the lovely sense of [Greek:
enaulos]--the sound being as of a stream passing always by in the same channel,--"so distinct
was everything to me. Two women laid hold of my hands and pulled me, each towards herself,
so violently, that I had like to have been pulled asunder; and they cried out against one another,--the
one, that she was resolved to have me to herself, being indeed her own, and the other that
it was vain for her to claim what belonged to others;--and the one who first claimed me for
her own was like a hard worker, and had strength as a man's; and her hair was dusty, and her
hand full of horny places, and her dress fastened tight about her, and the folds of it loaded
with white marble-dust, so that she looked just as my uncle used to look when he was filing
stones: but the other was pleasant in features, and delicate in form, and orderly in her dress;
and so in the end, they left it to me to decide, after hearing what they had to say, with which
of them I would go; and first the hard featured and masculine one spoke:--

36. "'Dear child, I am the Art of Image-sculpture, which yesterday you began to learn; and
I am as one of your own people, and of your house, for your grandfather,' (and she named my
mother's father) 'was a stone-cutter; and both your uncles had good name through me: and if
you will keep yourself well clear of the sillinesses and fluent follies that come from this
creature,' (and she pointed to the other woman) 'and will follow me, and live with me, first
of all, you shall be brought up as a man should be, and have strong shoulders; and, besides
that, you shall be kept well quit of all restless desires, and you shall never be obliged to
go away into any foreign places, leaving your own country and the people of your house; neither
shall all men praise you for your talk.[116] And you must not despise this rude serviceableness
of my body, neither this meanness of my dusty dress; for, pushing on in their strength from
such things as these, that great Phidias revealed Zeus, and Polyclitus wrought out Hera, and
Myron was praised, and Praxiteles marvelled at: therefore are these men worshipped with the gods.'"

37. There is a beautiful ambiguity in the use of the preposition with the genitive in this
last sentence. "Pushing on from these things" means indeed, justly, that the sculptors rose
from a mean state to a noble one; but not as leaving the mean state;--not as, from a hard life,
attaining to a soft one,--but as being helped and strengthened by the rough life to do what
was greatest. Again, "worshipped with the gods" does not mean that they are thought of as in
any sense equal to, or like to, the gods, but as being on the side of the gods against what
is base and ungodly; and that the kind of worth which is in them is therefore indeed worshipful,
as having its source with the gods. Finally, observe that every one of the expressions, used
of the four sculptors, is definitely the best that Lucian could have chosen. Phidias carved
like one who had seen Zeus, and had only to reveal him; Polyclitus, in labour of intellect,
completed his sculpture by just law, and wrought out Hera; Myron was of all most praised, because
he did best what pleased the vulgar; and Praxiteles, the most wondered at or admired, because
he bestowed utmost exquisiteness of beauty.

38. I am sorry not to go on with the dream; the more refined lady, as you may remember, is
liberal or gentlemanly Education, and prevails at last; so that Lucian becomes an author instead
of a sculptor, I think to his own regret, though to our present benefit. One more passage of
his I must refer you to, as illustrative of the point before us; the description of the temple
of the Syrian Hieropolis, where he explains the absence of the images of the sun and moon.
"In the temple itself," he says, "on the left hand as one goes in, there is set first the throne
of the sun; but no form of him is thereon, for of these two powers alone, the sun and the moon,
they show no carved images. And I also learned why this is their law, for they say that it
is permissible, indeed, to make of the other gods, graven images, since the forms of them are
not visible to all men. But Helios and Selenaia are everywhere clear-bright, and all men behold
them; what need is there therefore for sculptured work of these, who appear in the air?"

39. This, then, is the second instinct necessary to sculpture; the desire for the manifestation,
description, and companionship of unknown powers; and for possession of a bodily substance--the
"bronze Strasbourg," which you can embrace, and hang immortelles on the head of--instead of
an abstract idea. But if you get nothing more in the depth of the national mind than these
two feelings, the mimetic and idolizing instincts, there may be still no progress possible
for the arts except in delicacy of manipulation and accumulative caprice of design. You must
have not only the idolizing instinct, but an [Greek: êthos] which chooses the right thing to
idolize! Else, you will get states of art like those in China or India, non-progressive, and
in great part diseased and frightful, being wrought under the influence of foolish terror,
or foolish admiration. So that a third condition, completing and confirming both the others,
must exist in order to the development of the creative power.

40. This third condition is that the heart of the nation shall be set on the discovery of just
or equal law, and shall be from day to day developing that law more perfectly. The Greek school
of sculpture is formed during, and in consequence of, the national effort to discover the nature
of justice; the Tuscan, during, and in consequence of, the national effort to discover the
nature of justification. I assert to you at present briefly, what will, I hope, be the subject
of prolonged illustration hereafter.

41. Now when a nation with mimetic instinct and imaginative longing is also thus occupied earnestly
in the discovery of Ethic law, that effort gradually brings precision and truth into all its
manual acts; and the physical progress of sculpture as in the Greek, so in the Tuscan, school,
consists in gradually limiting what was before indefinite, in verifying what was inaccurate,
and in humanizing what was monstrous. I might perhaps content you by showing these external
phenomena, and by dwelling simply on the increasing desire of naturalness, which compels, in
every successive decade of years, literally, in the sculptured images, the mimicked bones to
come together, bone to his bone; and the flesh to come up upon them, until from a flattened
and pinched handful of clay, respecting which you may gravely question whether it was intended
for a human form at all;--by slow degrees, and added touch to touch, in increasing consciousness
of the bodily truth,--at last the Aphrodite of Melos stands before you, a perfect woman. But
all that search for physical accuracy is merely the external operation, in the arts, of the
seeking for truth in the inner soul; it is impossible without that higher effort, and the demonstration
of it would be worse than useless to you, unless I made you aware at the same time of its spiritual
cause.

42. Observe farther; the increasing truth in representation is co-relative with increasing
beauty in the thing to be represented. The pursuit of justice which regulates the imitative
effort, regulates also the development of the race into dignity of person, as of mind; and
their culminating art-skill attains the grasp of entire truth at the moment when the truth
becomes most lovely. And then, ideal sculpture may go on safely into portraiture. But I shall
not touch on the subject of portrait sculpture to-day; it introduces many questions of detail,
and must be a matter for subsequent consideration.

43. These then are the three great passions which are concerned in true sculpture. I cannot
find better, or, at least, more easily remembered, names for them than "the Instincts of Mimicry,
Idolatry, and Discipline;" meaning, by the last, the desire of equity and wholesome restraint,
in all acts and works of life. Now of these, there is no question but that the love of Mimicry
is natural and right, and the love of Discipline is natural and right. But it looks a grave
question whether the yearning for Idolatry, (the desire of companionship with images,) is right.
Whether, indeed, if such an instinct be essential to good sculpture, the art founded on it
can possibly be "fine" art.

44. I must now beg for your close attention, because I have to point out distinctions in modes
of conception which will appear trivial to you, unless accurately understood; but of an importance
in the history of art which cannot be overrated.

When the populace of Paris adorned the statue of Strasbourg with immortelles, none, even the
simplest of the pious decorators, would suppose that the city of Strasbourg itself, or any
spirit or ghost of the city, was actually there, sitting in the Place de la Concorde. The figure
was delightful to them as a visible nucleus for their fond thoughts about Strasbourg; but never
for a moment supposed to be Strasbourg.

Similarly, they might have taken delight in a statue purporting to represent a river instead
of a city,--the Rhine, or Garonne, suppose,--and have been touched with strong emotion in looking
at it, if the real river were dear to them, and yet never think for an instant that the statue
was the river.

And yet again, similarly, but much more distinctly, they might take delight in the beautiful
image of a god, because it gathered and perpetuated their thoughts about that god; and yet
never suppose, nor be capable of being deceived by any arguments into supposing, that the statue
was the god.

On the other hand, if a meteoric stone fell from the sky in the sight of a savage, and he picked
it up hot, he would most probably lay it aside in some, to him, sacred place, and believe the
stone itself to be a kind of god, and offer prayer and sacrifice to it.

In like manner, any other strange or terrifying object, such, for instance, as a powerfully
noxious animal or plant, he would be apt to regard in the same way; and very possibly also
construct for himself frightful idols of some kind, calculated to produce upon him a vague
impression of their being alive; whose imaginary anger he might deprecate or avert with sacrifice,
although incapable of conceiving in them any one attribute of exalted intellectual or moral nature.

45. If you will now refer to § 52-59 of my Introductory Lectures, you will find this distinction
between a resolute conception, recognized for such, and an involuntary apprehension of spiritual
existence, already insisted on at some length. And you will see more and more clearly as we
proceed, that the deliberate and intellectually commanded conception is not idolatrous in any
evil sense whatever, but is one of the grandest and wholesomest functions of the human soul;
and that the essence of evil idolatry begins only in the idea or belief of a real presence
of any kind, in a thing in which there is no such presence.

46. I need not say that the harm of the idolatry must depend on the certainty of the negative.
If there be a real presence in a pillar of cloud, in an unconsuming flame, or in a still small
voice, it is no sin to bow down before these.

But, as matter of historical fact, the idea of such presence has generally been both ignoble
and false, and confined to nations of inferior race, who are often condemned to remain for
ages in conditions of vile terror, destitute of thought. Nearly all Indian architecture and
Chinese design arise out of such a state: so also, though in a less gross degree, Ninevite
and Phoenician art, early Irish, and Scandinavian; the latter, however, with vital elements
of high intellect mingled in it from the first.

But the greatest races are never grossly subject to such terror, even in their childhood, and
the course of their minds is broadly divisible into three distinct stages.

47. (I.) In their infancy they begin to imitate the real animals about them, as my little girl
made the cats and mice, but with an undercurrent of partial superstition--a sense that there
must be more in the creatures than they can see; also they catch up vividly any of the fancies
of the baser nations round them, and repeat these more or less apishly, yet rapidly naturalizing
and beautifying them. They then connect all kinds of shapes together, compounding meanings
out of the old chimeras, and inventing new ones with the speed of a running wild-fire; but
always getting more of man into their images, and admitting less of monster or brute; their
own characters, meanwhile, expanding and purging themselves, and shaking off the feverish fancy,
as springing flowers shake the earth off their stalks.

48. (II.) In the second stage, being now themselves perfect men and women, they reach the conception
of true and great gods as existent in the universe; and absolutely cease to think of them as
in any wise present in statues or images; but they have now learned to make these statues beautifully
human, and to surround them with attributes that may concentrate their thoughts of the gods.
This is, in Greece, accurately the Pindaric time, just a little preceding the Phidian; the
Phidian is already dimmed with a faint shadow of infidelity; still, the Olympic Zeus may be
taken as a sufficiently central type of a statue which was no more supposed to be Zeus, than
the gold or elephants' tusks it was made of; but in which the most splendid powers of human
art were exhausted in representing a believed and honoured God to the happy and holy imagination
of a sincerely religious people.

49. (III.) The third stage of national existence follows, in which, the imagination having
now done its utmost, and being partly restrained by the sanctities of tradition, which permit
no farther change in the conceptions previously created, begins to be superseded by logical
deduction and scientific investigation. At the same moment, the elder artists having done all
that is possible in realizing the national conceptions of the Gods, the younger ones, forbidden
to change the scheme of existing representations, and incapable of doing anything better in
that kind, betake themselves to refine and decorate the old ideas with more attractive skill.
Their aims are thus more and more limited to manual dexterity, and their fancy paralyzed. Also,
in the course of centuries, the methods of every art continually improving, and being made
subjects of popular inquiry, praise is now to be got, for eminence in these, from the whole
mob of the nation; whereas intellectual design can never be discerned but by the few. So that
in this third æra, we find every kind of imitative and vulgar dexterity more and more cultivated;
while design and imagination are every day less cared for, and less possible.

50. Meanwhile, as I have just said, the leading minds in literature and science become continually
more logical and investigative; and, once that they are established in the habit of testing
facts accurately, a very few years are enough to convince all the strongest thinkers that the
old imaginative religion is untenable, and cannot any longer be honestly taught in its fixed
traditional form, except by ignorant persons. And at this point the fate of the people absolutely
depends on the degree of moral strength into which their hearts have been already trained.
If it be a strong, industrious, chaste, and honest race, the taking its old gods, or at least
the old forms of them, away from it, will indeed make it deeply sorrowful and amazed; but will
in no whit shake its will, nor alter its practice. Exceptional persons, naturally disposed
to become drunkards, harlots, and cheats, but who had been previously restrained from indulging
these dispositions by their fear of God, will, of course, break out into open vice, when that
fear is removed. But the heads of the families of the people, instructed in the pure habits
and perfect delights of an honest life, and to whom the thought of a Father in heaven had been
a comfort, not a restraint, will assuredly not seek relief from the discomfort of their orphanage
by becoming uncharitable and vile. Also the high leaders of their thought gather their whole
strength together in the gloom; and at the first entrance of this valley of the Shadow of Death,
look their new enemy full in the eyeless face of him, and subdue him, and his terror, under
their feet. "Metus omnes, et inexorabile fatum,... strepitumque Acherontis avari." This is
the condition of national soul expressed by the art, and the words, of Holbein, Durer, Shakspeare,
Pope, and Goethe.

51. But if the people, at the moment when the trial of darkness approaches, be not confirmed
in moral character, but are only maintaining a superficial virtue by the aid of a spectral
religion; the moment the staff of their faith is broken, the character of the race falls like
a climbing plant cut from its hold: then all the earthliest vices attack it as it lies in the
dust; every form of sensual and insane sin is developed, and half a century is sometimes enough
to close, in hopeless shame, the career of the nation in literature, art, and war.

52. Notably, within the last hundred years, all religion has perished from the practically
active national mind of France and England. No statesman in the senate of either country would
dare to use a sentence out of their acceptedly divine Revelation, as having now a literal authority
over them for their guidance, or even a suggestive wisdom for their contemplation. England,
especially, has cast her Bible full in the face of her former God; and proclaimed, with open
challenge to Him, her resolved worship of His declared enemy, Mammon. All the arts, therefore,
founded on religion, and sculpture chiefly, are here in England effete and corrupt, to a degree
which arts never were hitherto in the history of mankind: and it is possible to show you the
condition of sculpture living, and sculpture dead, in accurate opposition, by simply comparing
the nascent Pisan school in Italy with the existing school in England.

53. You were perhaps surprised at my placing in your educational series, as a type of original
Italian sculpture, the pulpit by Niccola Pisano in the Duomo of Siena. I would rather, had
it been possible, have given the pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in the Duomo of Pisa; but that pulpit
is dispersed in fragments through the upper galleries of the Duomo, and the cloister of the
Campo Santo; and the casts of its fragments now put together at Kensington are too coarse to
be of use to you. You may partly judge, however, of the method of their execution by the eagle's
head, which I have sketched from the marble in the Campo Santo (Edu., No. 113), and the lioness
with her cubs, (Edu., No. 103, more carefully studied at Siena); and I will get you other illustrations
in due time. Meanwhile, I want you to compare the main purpose of the Cathedral of Pisa, and
its associated Bell Tower, Baptistery, and Holy Field, with the main purpose of the principal
building lately raised for the people of London. In these days, we indeed desire no cathedrals;
but we have constructed an enormous and costly edifice, which, in claiming educational influence
over the whole London populace, and middle class, is verily the Metropolitan cathedral of this
century,--the Crystal Palace.

54. It was proclaimed, at its erection, an example of a newly discovered style of architecture,
greater than any hitherto known,--our best popular writers, in their enthusiasm, describing
it as an edifice of Fairyland. You are nevertheless to observe that this novel production of
fairy enchantment is destitute of every kind of sculpture, except the bosses produced by the
heads of nails and rivets; while the Duomo of Pisa, in the wreathen work of its doors, in the
foliage of its capitals, inlaid colour designs of its façade, embossed panels of its baptistery
font, and figure sculpture of its two pulpits, contained the germ of a school of sculpture
which was to maintain, through a subsequent period of four hundred years, the greatest power
yet reached by the arts of the world in description of Form, and expression of Thought.

55. Now it is easy to show you the essential cause of the vast discrepancy in the character
of these two buildings.

In the vault of the apse of the Duomo of Pisa, was a colossal image of Christ, in coloured
mosaic, bearing to the temple, as nearly as possible, the relation which the statue of Athena
bore to the Parthenon; and in the same manner, concentrating the imagination of the Pisan on
the attributes of the God in whom he believed.

In precisely the same position with respect to the nave of the building, but of larger size,
as proportioned to the three or four times greater scale of the whole, a colossal piece of
sculpture was placed by English designers, at the extremity of the Crystal Palace, in preparation
for their solemnities in honour of the birthday of Christ, in December, 1867 or 1868.

That piece of sculpture was the face of the clown in a pantomime, some twelve feet high from
brow to chin, which face, being moved by the mechanism which is our pride, every half minute
opened its mouth from ear to ear, showed its teeth, and revolved its eyes, the force of these
periodical seasons of expression being increased and explained by the illuminated inscription
underneath "Here we are again."

56. When it is assumed, and with too good reason, that the mind of the English populace is
to be addressed, in the principal Sacred Festival of its year, by sculpture such as this, I
need scarcely point out to you that the hope is absolutely futile of advancing their intelligence
by collecting within this building, (itself devoid absolutely of every kind of art, and so
vilely constructed that those who traverse it are continually in danger of falling over the
cross-bars that bind it together) examples of sculpture filched indiscriminately from the past
work, bad and good, of Turks, Greeks, Romans, Moors, and Christians, miscoloured, misplaced,
and misinterpreted;[117] here thrust into unseemly corners, and there mortised together into
mere confusion of heterogeneous obstacle; pronouncing itself hourly more intolerable in weariness,
until any kind of relief is sought from it in steam wheelbarrows or cheap toy-shops; and most
of all in beer and meat, the corks and the bones being dropped through the chinks in the damp
deal flooring of the English Fairy Palace.

57. But you will probably think me unjust in assuming that a building prepared only for the
amusement of the people can typically represent the architecture or sculpture of modern England.
You may urge, that I ought rather to describe the qualities of the refined sculpture which
is executed in large quantities for private persons belonging to the upper classes, and for
sepulchral and memorial purposes. But I could not now criticise that sculpture with any power
of conviction to you, because I have not yet stated to you the principles of good sculpture
in general. I will, however, in some points, tell you the facts by anticipation.

58. We have much excellent portrait sculpture; but portrait sculpture, which is nothing more,
is always third-rate work, even when produced by men of genius;--nor does it in the least require
men of genius to produce it. To paint a portrait, indeed, implies the very highest gifts of
painting; but any man, of ordinary patience and artistic feeling, can carve a satisfactory bust.

59. Of our powers in historical sculpture, I am, without question, just, in taking for sufficient
evidence the monuments we have erected to our two greatest heroes by sea and land; namely,
the Nelson Column, and the statue of the Duke of Wellington opposite Apsley House. Nor will
you, I hope, think me severe,--certainly, whatever you may think me, I am using only the most
temperate language, in saying of both these monuments, that they are absolutely devoid of high
sculptural merit. But, consider how much is involved in the fact thus dispassionately stated,
respecting the two monuments in the principal places of our capital, to our two greatest heroes.

60. Remember that we have before our eyes, as subjects of perpetual study and thought, the
art of all the world for three thousand years past: especially, we have the best sculpture
of Greece, for example of bodily perfection; the best of Rome, for example of character in
portraiture; the best of Florence, for example of romantic passion: we have unlimited access
to books and other sources of instruction; we have the most perfect scientific illustrations
of anatomy, both human and comparative; and, we have bribes for the reward of success, large,
in the proportion of at least twenty to one, as compared with those offered to the artists
of any other period. And with all these advantages, and the stimulus also of fame carried instantly
by the press to the remotest corners of Europe, the best efforts we can make, on the grandest
of occasions, result in work which it is impossible in any one particular to praise.

Now consider for yourselves what an intensity of the negation of the faculty of sculpture this
implies in the national mind! What measures can be assigned to the gulf of incapacity, which
can deliberately swallow up in the gorge of it the teaching and example of three thousand years,
and produce as the result of that instruction, what it is courteous to call "nothing?"

61. That is the conclusion at which we arrive, on the evidence presented by our historical
sculpture. To complete the measure of ourselves, we must endeavour to estimate the rank of
the two opposite schools of sculpture employed by us in the nominal service of religion, and
in the actual service of vice.

I am aware of no statue of Christ, nor of any apostle of Christ, nor of any scene related in
the New Testament, produced by us within the last three hundred years, which has possessed
even superficial merit enough to attract public attention.

Whereas the steadily immoral effect of the formative art which we learn, more or less apishly,
from the French schools, and employ, but too gladly, in manufacturing articles for the amusement
of the luxurious classes, must be ranked as one of the chief instruments used by joyful fiends
and angry fates, for the ruin of our civilization.

If, after I have set before you the nature and principles of true sculpture, in Athens, Pisa,
and Florence, you reconsider these facts,--(which you will then at once recognize as such),--you
will find that they absolutely justify my assertion that the state of sculpture in modern England,
as compared with that of the great Ancients, is literally one of corrupt and dishonourable
death, as opposed to bright and fameful life.

62. And now, will you bear with me, while I tell you finally why this is so?

The cause with which you are personally concerned is your own frivolity; though essentially
this is not your fault, but that of the system of your early training. But the fact remains
the same, that here, in Oxford, you, a chosen body of English youth, in no wise care for the
history of your country, for its present dangers, or its present duties. You still, like children
of seven or eight years old, are interested only in bats, balls, and oars: nay, including with
you the students of Germany and France, it is certain that the general body of modern European
youth have their minds occupied more seriously by the sculpture and painting of the bowls of
their tobacco-pipes, than by all the divinest workmanship and passionate imagination of Greece,
Rome, and Mediæval Christendom.

63. But the elementary causes, both of this frivolity in you, and of worse than frivolity in
older persons, are the two forms of deadly Idolatry which are now all but universal in England.

The first of these is the worship of the Eidolon, or Phantasm of Wealth; worship of which you
will find the nature partly examined in the 37th paragraph of my Munera Pulveris; but which
is briefly to be defined as the servile apprehension of an active power in Money, and the submission
to it as the God of our life.

64. The second elementary cause of the loss of our nobly imaginative faculty, is the worship
of the Letter, instead of the Spirit, in what we chiefly accept as the ordinance and teaching
of Deity; and the apprehension of a healing sacredness in the act of reading the Book whose
primal commands we refuse to obey.

No feather idol of Polynesia was ever a sign of a more shameful idolatry, than the modern notion
in the minds of certainly the majority of English religious persons, that the Word of God,
by which the heavens were of old, and the earth, standing out of the water and in the water,--the
Word of God which came to the prophets, and comes still for ever to all who will hear it, (and
to many who will forbear); and which, called Faithful and True, is to lead forth, in the judgment,
the armies of heaven,--that this "Word of God" may yet be bound at our pleasure in morocco,
and carried about in a young lady's pocket, with tasselled ribands to mark the passages she
most approves of.

65. Gentlemen, there has hitherto been seen no instance, and England is little likely to give
the unexampled spectacle, of a country successful in the noble arts, yet in which the youths
were frivolous, the maidens falsely religious, the men, slaves of money, and the matrons, of
vanity. Not from all the marble of the hills of Luni will such a people ever shape one statue
that may stand nobly against the sky; not from all the treasures bequeathed to them by the
great dead, will they gather, for their own descendants, any inheritance but shame.

"ambrosial" because it restores strength to the soul through its peace, as, in the 23rd Psalm,
the stillness of waters.

[117] "Falsely represented," would be the better expression. In the cast of the tomb of Queen
Eleanor, for a single instance, the Gothic foliage of which one essential virtue is its change
over every shield, is represented by a repetition of casts from one mould, of which the design
itself is entirely conjectural.

LECTURE III.

IMAGINATION.

November, 1870.

66. The principal object of the preceding lecture (and I choose rather to incur your blame
for tediousness in repeating, than for obscurity in defining it), was to enforce the distinction
between the ignoble and false phase of Idolatry, which consists in the attribution of a spiritual
power to a material thing; and the noble and truth-seeking phase of it, to which I shall in
these lectures[118] give the general term of Imagination;--that is to say, the invention of
material symbols which may lead us to contemplate the character and nature of gods, spirits,
or abstract virtues and powers, without in the least implying the actual presence of such Beings
among us, or even their possession, in reality, of the forms we attribute to them.

67. For instance, in the ordinarily received Greek type of Athena, on vases of the Phidian
time (sufficiently represented in the opposite woodcut), no Greek would have supposed the vase
on which this was painted to be itself Athena, nor to contain Athena inside of it, as the Arabian
fisherman's casket contained the genie; neither did he think that this rude black painting,
done at speed as the potter's fancy urged his hand, represented anything like the form or aspect
of the Goddess herself. Nor would he have thought so, even had the image been ever so beautifully
wrought. The goddess might, indeed, visibly appear under the form of an armed virgin, as she
might under that of a hawk or a swallow, when it pleased her to give such manifestation of
her presence; but it did not, therefore, follow that she was constantly invested with any of
these forms, or that the best which human skill could, even by her own aid, picture of her,
was, indeed, a likeness of her. The real use, at all events, of this rude image, was only to
signify to the eye and heart the facts of the existence, in some manner, of a Spirit of wisdom,
perfect in gentleness, irresistible in anger; having also physical dominion over the air which
is the life and breadth of all creatures, and clothed, to human eyes, with ægis of fiery cloud,
and raiment of falling dew.

68. In the yet more abstract conception of the Spirit of agriculture, in which the wings of
the chariot represent the winds of spring, and its crested dragons are originally a mere type
of the seed with its twisted root piercing the ground, and sharp-edged leaves rising above
it; we are in still less danger of mistaking the symbol for the presumed form of an actual
Person. But I must, with persistence, beg of you to observe that in all the noble actions of
imagination in this kind, the distinction from idolatry consists, not in the denial of the
being, or presence of the Spirit, but only in the due recognition of our human incapacity to
conceive the one, or compel the other.

69. Farther--and for this statement I claim your attention still more earnestly. As no nation
has ever attained real greatness during periods in which it was subject to any condition of
Idolatry, so no nation has ever attained or persevered in greatness, except in reaching and
maintaining a passionate Imagination of a spiritual estate higher than that of men; and of
spiritual creatures nobler than men, having a quite real and personal existence, however imperfectly
apprehended by us.

And all the arts of the present age deserving to be included under the name of sculpture have
been degraded by us, and all principles of just policy have vanished from us,--and that totally,--for
this double reason; that we are on one side, given up to idolatries of the most servile kind,
as I showed you in the close of the last lecture,--while, on the other hand, we have absolutely
ceased from the exercise of faithful imagination; and the only remnants of the desire of truth
which remain in us have been corrupted into a prurient itch to discover the origin of life
in the nature of the dust, and prove that the source of the order of the universe is the accidental
concurrence of its atoms.

70. Under these two calamities of our time, the art of sculpture has perished more totally
than any other, because the object of that art is exclusively the representation of form as
the exponent of life. It is essentially concerned only with the human form, which is the exponent
of the highest life we know; and with all subordinate forms only as they exhibit conditions
of vital power which have some certain relation to humanity. It deals with the "particula undique
desecta" of the animal nature, and itself contemplates, and brings forward for its disciples'
contemplation, all the energies of creation which transform the [Greek: pêlos], or lower still,
the [Greek: borboros] of the trivia, by Athena's help, into forms of power;--([Greek: to men
holon architektôn autos ên. syneirgazeto de toi kai ê 'Athêna empneousa ton pêlon kai empsycha
poiousa einai ta plasmata];)[119]--but it has nothing whatever to do with the representation
of forms not living, however beautiful, (as of clouds or waves); nor may it condescend to use
its perfect skill, except in expressing the noblest conditions of life.

These laws of sculpture, being wholly contrary to the practice of our day, I cannot expect
you to accept on my assertion, nor do I wish you to do so. By placing definitely good and bad
sculpture before you, I do not doubt but that I shall gradually prove to you the nature of
all excelling and enduring qualities; but to-day I will only confirm my assertions by laying
before you the statement of the Greeks themselves on the subject; given in their own noblest
time, and assuredly authoritative, in every point which it embraces, for all time to come.

71. If any of you have looked at the explanation I have given of the myth of Athena in my Queen
of the Air, you cannot but have been surprised that I took scarcely any note of the story of
her birth. I did not, because that story is connected intimately with the Apolline myths; and
is told of Athena, not essentially as the goddess of the air, but as the goddess of Art-Wisdom.

You have probably often smiled at the legend itself, or avoided thinking of it, as revolting.
It is indeed, one of the most painful and childish of sacred myths; yet remember, ludicrous
and ugly as it seems to us, this story satisfied the fancy of the Athenian people in their
highest state; and if it did not satisfy--yet it was accepted by, all later mythologists: you
may also remember I told you to be prepared to find that, given a certain degree of national
intellect, the ruder the symbol, the deeper would be its purpose. And this legend of the birth
of Athena is the central myth of all that the Greeks have left us respecting the power of their
arts; and in it they have expressed, as it seemed good to them, the most important things they
had to tell us on these matters. We may read them wrongly; but we must read them here, if anywhere.

72. There are so many threads to be gathered up in the legend, that I cannot hope to put it
before you in total clearness, but I will take main points. Athena is born in the island of
Rhodes; and that island is raised out of the sea by Apollo, after he had been left without
inheritance among the gods. Zeus[120] would have cast the lot again, but Apollo orders the
golden-girdled Lachesis to stretch out her hands; and not now by chance or lot, but by noble
enchantment, the island rises out of the sea.

Physically, this represents the action of heat and light on chaos, especially on the deep sea.
It is the "Fiat lux" of Genesis, the first process in the conquest of Fate by Harmony. The
island is dedicated to the Nymph Rhodos, by whom Apollo has the seven sons who teach [Greek:
sophôtata noêmata]; because the rose is the most beautiful organism existing in matter not
vital, expressive of the direct action of light on the earth, giving lovely form and colour
at once; (compare the use of it by Dante as the form of the sainted crowd in highest heaven)
and remember that, therefore, the rose is in the Greek mind, essentially a Doric flower, expressing
the worship of Light, as the Iris or Ion is an Ionic one, expressing the worship of the Winds
and Dew.

73. To understand the agency of Hephæstus at the birth of Athena, we must again return to the
founding of the arts on agriculture by the hand. Before you can cultivate land you must clear
it; and the characteristic weapon of Hephæstus,--which is as much his attribute as the trident
is of Poseidon, and the rhabdos of Hermes, is not, as you would have expected, the hammer,
but the clearing-axe--the doubled-edged [Greek: pélekys], the same that Calypso gives Ulysses
with which to cut down the trees for his home voyage; so that both the naval and agricultural
strength of the Athenians are expressed by this weapon, with which they had to hew out their
fortune. And you must keep in mind this agriculturally laborious character of Hephæstus, even
when he is most distinctly the god of serviceable fire; thus Horace's perfect epithet for him
"avidus" expresses at once the devouring eagerness of fire, and the zeal of progressive labour,
for Horace gives it to him when he is fighting against the giants. And this rude symbol of
his cleaving the forehead of Zeus with the axe, and giving birth to Athena signifies, indeed,
physically the thrilling power of heat in the heavens, rending the clouds, and giving birth
to the blue air; but far more deeply it signifies the subduing of adverse Fate by true labour;
until, out of the chasm, cleft by resolute and industrious fortitude, springs the Spirit of Wisdom.

74. Here (Fig. 4) is an early drawing of the myth, to which I shall have to refer afterwards
in illustration of the childishness of the Greek mind at the time when its art-symbols were
first fixed; but it is of peculiar value, because the physical character of Vulcan, as fire,
is indicated by his wearing the [Greek: endromides] of Hermes, while the antagonism of Zeus,
as the adverse chaos, either of cloud or of fate, is shown by his striking at Hephæstus with
his thunderbolt. But Plate IV. gives you (as far as the light on the rounded vase will allow
it to be deciphered) a characteristic representation of the scene, as conceived in later art.

75. I told you in a former lecture of this course that the entire Greek intellect was in a
childish phase as compared to that of modern times. Observe, however, childishness does not
necessarily imply universal inferiority: there may be a vigorous, acute, pure, and solemn childhood,
and there may be a weak, foul, and ridiculous condition of advanced life; but the one is still
essentially the childish, and the other the adult phase of existence.

76. You will find, then, that the Greeks were the first people that were born into complete
humanity. All nations before them had been, and all around them still were, partly savage,
bestial, clay-encumbered, inhuman; still semi-goat, or semi-ant, or semi-stone, or semi-cloud.
But the power of a new spirit came upon the Greeks, and the stones were filled with breath,
and the clouds clothed with flesh; and then came the great spiritual battle between the Centaurs
and Lapithæ; and the living creatures became "Children of Men." Taught, yet, by the Centaur--sown,
as they knew, in the fang--from the dappled skin of the brute, from the leprous scale of the
serpent, their flesh came again as the flesh of a little child, and they were clean.

Fix your mind on this as the very central character of the Greek race--the being born pure
and human out of the brutal misery of the past, and looking abroad, for the first time, with
their children's eyes, wonderingly open, on the strange and divine world.

77. Make some effort to remember, so far as may be possible to you, either what you felt in
yourselves when you were young, or what you have observed in other children, of the action
of thought and fancy. Children are continually represented as living in an ideal world of their
own. So far as I have myself observed, the distinctive character of a child is to live always
in the tangible present, having little pleasure in memory, and being utterly impatient and
tormented by anticipation: weak alike in reflection and forethought, but having an intense
possession of the actual present, down to the shortest moments and least objects of it; possessing
it, indeed, so intensely that the sweet childish days are as long as twenty days will be; and
setting all the faculties of heart and imagination on little things, so as to be able to make
anything out of them he chooses. Confined to a little garden, he does not imagine himself somewhere
else, but makes a great garden out of that; possessed of an acorn-cup, he will not despise
it and throw it away, and covet a golden one in its stead: it is the adult who does so. The
child keeps his acorn-cup as a treasure, and makes a golden one out of it in his mind; so that
the wondering grown-up person standing beside him is always tempted to ask concerning his treasures,
not, "What would you have more than these?" but "What possibly can you see in these?" for,
to the bystander, there is a ludicrous and incomprehensible inconsistency between the child's
words and the reality. The little thing tells him gravely, holding up the acorn-cup, that "this
is a queen's crown, or a fairy's boat," and, with beautiful effrontery, expects him to believe
the same. But observe--the acorn-cup must be there, and in his own hand. "Give it me;" then
I will make more of it for myself. That is the child's one word, always.

78. It is also the one word of the Greek--"Give it me." Give me any thing definite here in
my sight, then I will make more of it.

I cannot easily express to you how strange it seems to me that I am obliged, here in Oxford,
to take the position of an apologist for Greek art; that I find, in spite of all the devotion
of the admirable scholars who have so long maintained in our public schools the authority of
Greek literature, our younger students take no interest in the manual work of the people upon
whose thoughts the tone of their early intellectual life has exclusively depended. But I am
not surprised that the interest, if awakened, should not at first take the form of admiration.
The inconsistency between an Homeric description of a piece of furniture or armour, and the
actual rudeness of any piece of art approximating within even three or four centuries, to the
Homeric period, is so great, that we at first cannot recognize the art as elucidatory of, or
in any way related to, the poetic language.

79. You will find, however, exactly the same kind of discrepancy between early sculpture, and
the languages of deed and thought, in the second birth, and childhood, of the world, under
Christianity. The same fair thoughts and bright imaginations arise again; and similarly, the
fancy is content with the rudest symbols by which they can be formalized to the eyes. You cannot
understand that the rigid figure (2) with chequers or spots on its breast, and sharp lines
of drapery to its feet, could represent, to the Greek, the healing majesty of heaven: but can
you any better understand how a symbol so haggard as this (Fig. 5) could represent to the noblest
hearts of the Christian ages the power and ministration of angels? Yet it not only did so,
but retained in the rude undulatory and linear ornamentation of its dress, record of the thoughts
intended to be conveyed by the spotted ægis and falling chiton of Athena, eighteen hundred
years before. Greek and Venetian alike, in their noble childhood, knew with the same terror
the coiling wind and congealed hail in heaven--saw with the same thankfulness the dew shed
softly on the earth, and on its flowers; and both recognized, ruling these, and symbolized
by them, the great helpful spirit of Wisdom, which leads the children of men to all knowledge,
all courage, and all art.

80. Read the inscription written on the sarcophagus (Plate V.), at the extremity of which this
angel is sculptured. It stands in an open recess in the rude brick wall of the west front of
the church of St. John and Paul at Venice, being the tomb of the two doges, father and son,
Jacopo and Lorenzo Tiepolo. This is the inscription:--

    "Quos natura pares studiis, virtutibus, arte
    Edidit, illustres genitor natusque, sepulti
    Hác sub rupe Duces. Venetum charissima proles
    Theupula collatis dedit hos celebranda triumphis.
    Omnia presentis donavit predia templi
    Dux Jacobus: valido fixit moderamine leges
    Urbis, et ingratam redimens certamine Jadram
    Dalmatiosque dedit patrie, post, Marte subactas
    Graiorum pelago maculavit sanguine classes.
    Suscipit oblatos princeps Laurentius Istros,
    Et domuit rigidos, ingenti strage cadentes,
    Bononie populos. Hinc subdita Cervia cessit.
    Fundavere vias pacis; fortique relictá
    Re, superos sacris petierunt mentibus ambo.

    "Dominus Jachobus hobiit[121] M.CCLI.
     Dominus Laurentius hobiit M.CCLXXVIII."

You see, therefore, this tomb is an invaluable example of thirteenth century sculpture in Venice.
In Plate VI., you have an example of the (coin) sculpture of the date accurately corresponding
in Greece to the thirteenth century in Venice, when the meaning of symbols was everything and
the workmanship comparatively nothing. The upper head is an Athena, of Athenian work in the
seventh or sixth century--(the coin itself may have been struck later, but the archaic type
was retained). The two smaller impressions below are the front and obverse of a coin of the
same age from Corinth, the head of Athena on one side, and Pegasus, with the archaic Koppa,
on the other. The smaller head is bare, the hair being looped up at the back and closely bound
with an olive branch. You are to note this general outline of the head, already given in a
more finished type in Plate II., as a most important elementary form in the finest sculpture,
not of Greece only, but of all Christendom. In the upper head the hair is restrained still
more closely by a round helmet, for the most part smooth, but embossed with a single flower
tendril, having one bud, one flower, and above it, two olive leaves. You have thus the most
absolutely restricted symbol possible to human thought of the power of Athena over the flowers
and trees of the earth. An olive leaf by itself could not have stood for the sign of a tree,
but the two can, when set in position of growth.

I would not give you the reverse of the coin on the same plate, because you would have looked
at it only, laughed at it, and not examined the rest; but here it is, wonderfully engraved
for you (Fig. 6): of it we shall have more to say afterwards.

81. And now as you look at these rude vestiges of the religion of Greece, and at the vestiges,
still ruder, on the Ducal tomb, of the religion of Christendom, take warning against two opposite
errors.

There is a school of teachers who will tell you that nothing but Greek art is deserving of
study, and that all our work at this day should be an imitation of it.

Whenever you feel tempted to believe them, think of these portraits of Athena and her owl,
and be assured that Greek art is not in all respects perfect, nor exclusively deserving of
imitation.

There is another school of teachers who will tell you that Greek art is good for nothing; that
the soul of the Greek was outcast, and that Christianity entirely superseded its faith, and
excelled its works.

Whenever you feel tempted to believe them, think of this angel on the tomb of Jacopo Tiepolo;
and remember, that Christianity, after it had been twelve hundred years existent as an imaginative
power on the earth, could do no better work than this, though with all the former power of
Greece to help it; nor was able to engrave its triumph in having stained its fleets in the
seas of Greece with the blood of her people, but between barbarous imitations of the pillars
which that people had invented.

82. Receiving these two warnings, receive also this lesson; In both examples, childish though
it be, this Heathen and Christian art is alike sincere, and alike vividly imaginative: the
actual work is that of infancy; the thoughts, in their visionary simplicity, are also the thoughts
of infancy, but in their solemn virtue, they are the thoughts of men.

We, on the contrary, are now, in all that we do, absolutely without sincerity;--absolutely,
therefore, without imagination, and without virtue. Our hands are dexterous with the vile and
deadly dexterity of machines; our minds filled with incoherent fragments of faith, which we
cling to in cowardice, without believing, and make pictures of in vanity, without loving. False
and base alike, whether we admire or imitate, we cannot learn from the Heathen's art, but only
pilfer it; we cannot revive the Christian's art, but only galvanize it; we are, in the sum
of us, not human artists at all, but mechanisms of conceited clay, masked in the furs and feathers
of living creatures, and convulsed with voltaic spasms, in mockery of animation.

83. You think, perhaps, that I am using terms unjustifiable in violence. They would, indeed,
be unjustifiable, if, spoken from this chair, they were violent at all. They are, unhappily,
temperate and accurate,--except in shortcoming of blame. For we are not only impotent to restore,
but strong to defile, the work of past ages. Of the impotence, take but this one, utterly humiliatory,
and, in the full meaning of it, ghastly, example. We have lately been busy embanking, in the
capital of the country, the river which, of all its waters, the imagination of our ancestors
had made most sacred, and the bounty of nature most useful. Of all architectural features of
the metropolis, that embankment will be, in future, the most conspicuous; and in its position
and purpose it was the most capable of noble adornment.

For that adornment, nevertheless, the utmost which our modern poetical imagination has been
able to invent, is a row of gas-lamps. It has, indeed, farther suggested itself to our minds
as appropriate to gas-lamps set beside a river, that the gas should come out of fishes' tails;
but we have not ingenuity enough to cast so much as a smelt or a sprat for ourselves; so we
borrow the shape of a Neapolitan marble, which has been the refuse of the plate and candlestick
shops in every capital of Europe for the last fifty years. We cast that badly, and give lustre
to the ill-cast fish with lacquer in imitation of bronze. On the base of their pedestals, towards
the road, we put for advertisement's sake, the initials of the casting firm; and, for farther
originality and Christianity's sake, the caduceus of Mercury; and to adorn the front of the
pedestals towards the river, being now wholly at our wit's end, we can think of nothing better
than to borrow the door-knocker which--again for the last fifty years--has disturbed and decorated
two or three millions of London street-doors; and magnifying the marvellous device of it, a
lion's head with a ring in its mouth (still borrowed from the Greek), we complete the embankment
with a row of heads and rings, on a scale which enables them to produce, at the distance at
which only they can be seen, the exact effect of a row of sentry boxes.

84. Farther. In the very centre of the city, and at the point where the Embankment commands
a view of Westminster Abbey on one side and of St. Paul's on the other--that is to say, at
precisely the most important and stately moment of its whole course--it has to pass under one
of the arches of Waterloo Bridge, which, in the sweep of its curve, is as vast--it alone--as
the Rialto at Venice, and scarcely less seemly in proportions. But over the Rialto, though
of late and debased Venetian work, there still reigns some power of human imagination: on the
two flanks of it are carved the Virgin and the Angel of the Annunciation; on the keystone the
descending Dove. It is not, indeed, the fault of living designers that the Waterloo arch is
nothing more than a gloomy and hollow heap of wedged blocks of blind granite. But just beyond
the damp shadow of it, the new Embankment is reached by a flight of stairs, which are, in point
of fact, the principal approach to it, a-foot, from central London; the descent from the very
midst of the metropolis of England to the banks of the chief river of England; and for this
approach, living designers are answerable.

85. The principal decoration of the descent is again a gas-lamp, but a shattered one, with
a brass crown on the top of it or, rather, half-crown, and that turned the wrong way, the back
of it to the river and causeway, its flame supplied by a visible pipe far wandering along the
wall; the whole apparatus being supported by a rough cross-beam. Fastened to the centre of
the arch above is a large placard, stating that the Royal Humane Society's drags are in constant
readiness, and that their office is at 4, Trafalgar Square. On each side of the arch are temporary,
but dismally old and battered boardings, across two angles capable of unseemly use by the British
public. Above one of these is another placard, stating that this is the Victoria Embankment.
The steps themselves--some forty of them--descend under a tunnel, which the shattered gas-lamp
lights by night, and nothing by day. They are covered with filthy dust, shaken off from infinitude
of filthy feet; mixed up with shreds of paper, orange-peel, foul straw, rags, and cigar ends,
and ashes; the whole agglutinated, more or less, by dry saliva into slippery blotches and patches;
or, when not so fastened, blown dismally by the sooty wind hither and thither, or into the
faces of those who ascend and descend. The place is worth your visit, for you are not likely
to find elsewhere a spot which, either in costly and ponderous brutality of building, or in
the squalid and indecent accompaniment of it, is so far separated from the peace and grace
of nature, and so accurately indicative of the methods of our national resistance to the Grace,
Mercy, and Peace of Heaven.

86. I am obliged always to use the English word "Grace" in two senses, but remember that the
Greek [Greek: charis] includes them both (the bestowing, that is to say of Beauty and Mercy);
and especially it includes these in the passage of Pindar's first ode, which gives us the key
to the right interpretation of the power of sculpture in Greece. You remember that I told you,
in my Sixth Introductory Lecture (§ 151), that the mythic accounts of Greek sculpture begin
in the legends of the family of Tantalus; and especially in the most grotesque legend of them
all, the inlaying of the ivory shoulder of Pelops. At that story Pindar pauses--not, indeed,
without admiration, nor alleging any impossibility in the circumstances themselves, but doubting
the careless hunger of Demeter--and gives his own reading of the event, instead of the ancient
one. He justifies this to himself, and to his hearers, by the plea that myths have, in some
sort, or degree, ([Greek: pou ti]), led the mind of mortals beyond the truth: and then he goes
on:--

"Grace, which creates everything that is kindly and soothing for mortals, adding honour, has
often made things at first untrustworthy, become trustworthy through Love."

87. I cannot, except in these lengthened terms, give you the complete force of the passage;
especially of the [Greek: apiston emêsato pioton]--"made it trustworthy by passionate desire
that it should be so"--which exactly describes the temper of religious persons at the present
day, who are kindly and sincere, in clinging to the forms of faith which either have long been
precious to themselves, or which they feel to have been without question instrumental in advancing
the dignity of mankind. And it is part of the constitution of humanity--a part which, above
others, you are in danger of unwisely contemning under the existing conditions of our knowledge,
that the things thus sought for belief with eager passion, do, indeed, become trustworthy to
us; that, to each of us, they verily become what we would have them; the force of the [Greek:
mênis] and [Greek: mnêmê] with which we seek after them, does, indeed, make them powerful to
us for actual good or evil; and it is thus granted to us to create not only with our hands
things that exalt or degrade our sight, but with our hearts also, things that exalt or degrade
our souls; giving true substance to all that we hoped for; evidence to things that we have
not seen, but have desired to see; and calling, in the sense of creating, things that are not,
as though they were.

88. You remember that in distinguishing Imagination from Idolatry, I referred you to the forms
of passionate affection with which a noble people commonly regards the rivers and springs of
its native land. Some conception of personality or of spiritual power in the stream, is almost
necessarily involved in such emotion; and prolonged [Greek: charis] in the form of gratitude,
the return of Love for benefits continually bestowed, at last alike in all the highest and
the simplest minds, when they are honourable and pure, makes this untrue thing trustworthy;
[Greek: apiston emêsato piston], until it becomes to them the safe basis of some of the happiest
impulses of their moral nature. Next to the marbles of Verona, given you as a primal type of
the sculpture of Christianity, moved to its best energy in adorning the entrance of its temples,
I have not unwillingly placed, as your introduction to the best sculpture of the religion of
Greece, the forms under which it represented the personality of the fountain Arethusa. But,
without restriction to those days of absolute devotion, let me simply point out to you how
this untrue thing, made true by Love, has intimate and heavenly authority even over the minds
of men of the most practical sense, the most shrewd wit, and the most severe precision of moral
temper. The fair vision of Sabrina in Comus, the endearing and tender promise, "Fies nobilium
tu quoque fontium," and the joyful and proud affection of the great Lombard's address to the
lakes of his enchanted land,--

                 Te, Lari maxume, teque
    Fluctibus et fremitu assurgens, Benace, marino,

may surely be remembered by you with regretful piety, when you stand by the blank stones which
at once restrain and disgrace your native river, as the final worship rendered to it by modern
philosophy. But a little incident which I saw last summer on its bridge at Wallingford, may
put the contrast of ancient and modern feeling before you still more forcibly.

89. Those of you who have read with attention (none of us can read with too much attention),
Molière's most perfect work, the Misanthrope, must remember Celiméne's description of her lovers,
and her excellent reason for being unable to regard with any favour, "notre grand flandrin
de vicomte,--depuis que je l'ai vu, trois quarts d'heure durant, cracher dans un puits pour
faire des ronds." That sentence is worth noting, both in contrast to the reverence paid by
the ancients to wells and springs, and as one of the most interesting traces of the extension
of the loathsome habit among the upper classes of Europe and America, which now renders all
external grace, dignity, and decency, impossible in the thoroughfares of their principal cities.
In connection with that sentence of Molière's you may advisably also remember this fact, which
I chanced to notice on the bridge of Wallingford. I was walking from end to end of it, and
back again, one Sunday afternoon of last May, trying to conjecture what had made this especial
bend and ford of the Thames so important in all the Anglo-Saxon wars. It was one of the few
sunny afternoons of the bitter spring, and I was very thankful for its light, and happy in
watching beneath it the flow and the glittering of the classical river, when I noticed a well-dressed
boy, apparently just out of some orderly Sunday-school, leaning far over the parapet; watching,
as I conjectured, some bird or insect on the bridge-buttress. I went up to him to see what
he was looking at; but just as I got close to him, he started over to the opposite parapet,
and put himself there into the same position, his object being, as I then perceived, to spit
from both sides upon the heads of a pleasure party who were passing in a boat below.

90. The incident may seem to you too trivial to be noticed in this place. To me, gentlemen,
it was by no means trivial. It meant, in the depth of it, such absence of all true [Greek:
charis], reverence, and intellect, as it is very dreadful to trace in the mind of any human
creature, much more in that of a child educated with apparently every advantage of circumstance
in a beautiful English country town, within ten miles of our University. Most of all, is it
terrific when we regard it as the exponent (and this, in truth, it is), of the temper which,
as distinguished from former methods, either of discipline or recreation, the present tenor
of our general teaching fosters in the mind of youth;--teaching which asserts liberty to be
a right, and obedience a degradation; and which, regardless alike of the fairness of nature
and the grace of behaviour, leaves the insolent spirit and degraded senses to find their only
occupation in malice, and their only satisfaction in shame.

91. You will, I hope, proceed with me, not scornfully any more, to trace, in the early art
of a noble heathen nation, the feeling of what was at least a better childishness than this
of ours; and the efforts to express, though with hands yet failing, and minds oppressed by
ignorant phantasy, the first truth by which they knew that they lived; the birth of wisdom
and of all her powers of help to man, as the reward of his resolute labour.

92. "[Greek: Aphaistou technaisi]." Note that word of Pindar in the Seventh Olympic. This axe-blow
of Vulcan's was to the Greek mind truly what Clytemnestra falsely asserts hers to have been
"[Greek: tês de dexias cheros ergon dikaias tektonos]"; physically, it meant the opening of
the blue through the rent clouds of heaven, by the action of local terrestrial heat of Hephæstus
as opposed to Apollo, who shines on the surface of the upper clouds, but cannot pierce them;
and, spiritually, it meant the first birth of prudent thought out of rude labour, the clearing-axe
in the hand of the woodman being the practical elementary sign of his difference from the wild
animals of the wood. Then he goes on, "From the high head of her Father, Athenaia rushing forth,
cried with her great and exceeding cry; and the Heaven trembled at her, and the Earth Mother."
The cry of Athena, I have before pointed out, physically distinguishes her, as the spirit of
the air, from silent elemental powers; but in this grand passage of Pindar it is again the
mythic cry of which he thinks; that is to say, the giving articulate words, by intelligence,
to the silence of Fate. "Wisdom crieth aloud, she uttereth her voice in the streets," and Heaven
and Earth tremble at her reproof.

93. Uttereth her voice in "the streets." For all men, that is to say; but to what work did
the Greeks think that her voice was to call them? What was to be the impulse communicated by
her prevailing presence; what the sign of the people's obedience to her?

This was to be the sign--"But she, the goddess herself, gave to them to prevail over the dwellers
upon earth, with best-labouring hands in every art. And by their paths there were the likenesses
of living and of creeping things; and the glory was deep. For to the cunning workman, greater
knowledge comes, undeceitful."

94. An infinitely pregnant passage, this, of which to-day you are to note mainly these three
things: First, that Athena is the goddess of Doing, not at all of sentimental inaction. She
is begotten, as it were, of the woodman's axe; her purpose is never in a word only, but in
a word and a blow. She guides the hands that labour best, in every art.

95. Secondly. The victory given by Wisdom, the worker, to the hands that labour best, is that
the streets and ways, [Greek: keleuthoi], shall be filled by likenesses of living and creeping
things?

Things living, and creeping! Are the Reptile things not alive then? You think Pindar wrote
that carelessly? or that, if he had only known a little modern anatomy, instead of "reptile"
things, he would have said "monochondylous" things? Be patient, and let us attend to the main
points first.

Sculpture, it thus appears, is the only work of wisdom that the Greeks care to speak of; they
think it involves and crowns every other. Image-making art; this is Athena's, as queenliest
of the arts. Literature, the order and the strength of word, of course belongs to Apollo and
the Muses; under Athena are the Substances and the Forms of things.

96, Thirdly. By this forming of Images there is to be gained a "deep"--that is to say--a weighty,
and prevailing, glory; not a floating nor fugitive one. For to the cunning workman, greater
knowledge comes, "undeceitful."

"[Greek: Daenti]" I am forced to use two English words to translate that single Greek one.
The "cunning" workman, thoughtful in experience, touch, and vision of the thing to be done;
no machine, witless, and of necessary motion; yet not cunning only, but having perfect habitual
skill of hand also; the confirmed reward of truthful doing. Recollect, in connection with this
passage of Pindar, Homer's three verses about getting the lines of ship-timber true, (Il. xv. 410)

    [Greek:
    "All' ôste stathmê dory nêion exithynei
    tektonos en palamêsi daêmonos, hos ra te pasês
    ed eidê sophiês, upothêmosynêsin Athênês,"]

and the beautiful epithet of Persephone, "[Greek: daeira]," as the Tryer and Knower of good
work; and remembering these, trust Pindar for the truth of his saying, that to the cunning
workman--(and let me solemnly enforce the words by adding--that to him only,) knowledge comes
undeceitful.

97. You may have noticed, perhaps, and with a smile, as one of the paradoxes you often hear
me blamed for too fondly stating, what I told you in the close of my Third Introductory Lecture,
that "so far from art's being immoral, little else except art is moral." I have now farther
to tell you, that little else, except art, is wise; that all knowledge, unaccompanied by a
habit of useful action, is too likely to become deceitful, and that every habit of useful action
must resolve itself into some elementary practice of manual labour. And I would, in all sober
and direct earnestness advise you, whatever may be the aim, predilection, or necessity of your
lives, to resolve upon this one thing at least, that you will enable yourselves daily to do
actually with your hands, something that is useful to mankind. To do anything well with your
hands, useful or not;--to be, even in trifling, [Greek: palamêsi daêmôn] is already much;--when
we come to examine the art of the middle ages I shall be able to show you that the strongest
of all influences of right then brought to bear upon character was the necessity for exquisite
manual dexterity in the management of the spear and bridle; and in your own experience most
of you will be able to recognize the wholesome effect, alike on body and mind, of striving,
within proper limits of time, to become either good batsmen, or good oarsmen. But the bat and
the racer's oar are children's toys. Resolve that you will be men in usefulness, as well as
in strength; and you will find that then also, but not till then, you can become men in understanding;
and that every fine vision and subtle theorem will present itself to you thenceforward undeceitfully,
[Greek: hypothêmosynêsin Athênês].

98. But there is more to be gathered yet from the words of Pindar. He is thinking, in his brief,
intense way, at once of Athena's work on the soul, and of her literal power on the dust of
the Earth. His "[Greek: keleuthoi]" is a wide word meaning all the paths of sea and land. Consider,
therefore, what Athena's own work actually is--in the literal fact of it. The blue, clear air
is the sculpturing power upon the earth and sea. Where the surface of the earth is reached
by that, and its matter and substance inspired with, and filled by that, organic form becomes
possible. You must indeed have the sun, also, and moisture; the kingdom of Apollo risen out
of the sea: but the sculpturing of living things, shape by shape, is Athena's, so that under
the brooding spirit of the air, what was without form, and void brings forth the moving creature
that hath life.

99. That is her work then--the giving of Form; then the separately Apolline work is the giving
of Light; or, more strictly, Sight: giving that faculty to the retina to which we owe not merely
the idea of light, but the existence of it; for light is to be defined only as the sensation
produced in the eye of an animal, under given conditions; those same conditions being, to a
stone, only warmth or chemical influence, but not light. And that power of seeing, and the
other various personalities and authorities of the animal body, in pleasure and pain, have
never, hitherto, been, I do not say, explained, but in any wise touched or approached by scientific
discovery. Some of the conditions of mere external animal form and of muscular vitality have
been shown; but for the most part that is true, even of external form, which I wrote six years
ago. "You may always stand by Form against Force. To a painter, the essential character of
anything is the form of it, and the philosophers cannot touch that. They come and tell you,
for instance, that there is as much heat, or motion, or calorific energy (or whatever else
they like to call it), in a tea-kettle, as in a gier-eagle. Very good: that is so; and it is
very interesting. It requires just as much heat as will boil the kettle, to take the gier-eagle
up to his nest, and as much more to bring him down again on a hare or a partridge. But we painters,
acknowledging the equality and similarity of the kettle and the bird in all scientific respects,
attach, for our part, our principal interest to the difference in their forms. For us, the
primarily cognisable facts, in the two things, are, that the kettle has a spout, and the eagle
a beak; the one a lid on its back, the other a pair of wings; not to speak of the distinction
also of volition, which the philosophers may properly call merely a form or mode of force--but,
then to an artist, the form or mode is the gist of the business."

100. As you will find that it is, not to the artist only, but to all of us. The laws under
which matter is collected and constructed are the same throughout the universe: the substance
so collected, whether for the making of the eagle, or the worm, may be analyzed into gaseous
identity; a diffusive vital force, apparently so closely related to mechanically measurable
heat as to admit the conception of its being itself mechanically measurable, and unchanging
in total quantity, ebbs and flows alike through the limbs of men, and the fibres of insects.
But, above all this, and ruling every grotesque or degraded accident of this, are two laws
of beauty in form, and of nobility in character, which stand in the chaos of creation between
the Living and the Dead, to separate the things that have in them a sacred and helpful, from
those that have in them an accursed and destroying, nature; and the power of Athena, first
physically put forth in the sculpturing of these [Greek: zôa and erpeta], these living and
reptile things, is put forth, finally, in enabling the hearts of men to discern the one from
the other; to know the unquenchable fires of the Spirit from the unquenchable fires of Death;
and to choose, not unaided, between submission to the Love that cannot end, or to the Worm
that cannot die.

101. The unconsciousness of their antagonism is the most notable characteristic of the modern
scientific mind; and I believe no credulity or fallacy admitted by the weakness (or it may
sometimes rather have been the strength) of early imagination, indicates so strange a depression
beneath the due scale of human intellect, as the failure of the sense of beauty in form, and
loss of faith in heroism of conduct, which have become the curses of recent science,[122] art,
and policy.

102. That depression of intellect has been alike exhibited in the mean consternation confessedly
felt on one side, and the mean triumph apparently felt on the other, during the course of the
dispute now pending as to the origin of man. Dispute for the present, not to be decided, and
of which the decision is to persons in the modern temper of mind, wholly without significance:
and I earnestly desire that you, my pupils, may have firmness enough to disengage your energies
from investigation so premature and so fruitless, and sense enough to perceive that it does
not matter how you have been made, so long as you are satisfied with being what you are. If
you are dissatisfied with yourselves, it ought not to console, but humiliate you, to imagine
that you were once seraphs; and if you are pleased with yourselves, it is not any ground of
reasonable shame to you if, by no fault of your own, you have passed through the elementary
condition of apes.

103. Remember, therefore, that it is of the very highest importance that you should know what
you are, and determine to be the best that you may be; but it is of no importance whatever,
except as it may contribute to that end, to know what you have been. Whether your Creator shaped
you with fingers, or tools, as a sculptor would a lump of clay, or gradually raised you to
manhood through a series of inferior forms, is only of moment to you in this respect--that
in the one case you cannot expect your children to be nobler creatures than you are yourselves--in
the other, every act and thought of your present life may be hastening the advent of a race
which will look back to you, their fathers (and you ought at least to have attained the dignity
of desiring that it may be so), with incredulous disdain.

104. But that you are yourselves capable of that disdain and dismay; that you are ashamed of
having been apes, if you ever were so; that you acknowledge instinctively, a relation of better
and worse, and a law respecting what is noble and base, which makes it no question to you that
the man is worthier than the baboon--this is a fact of infinite significance. This law of preference
in your hearts is the true essence of your being, and the consciousness of that law is a more
positive existence than any dependent on the coherence or forms of matter.

105. Now, but a few words more of mythology, and I have done. Remember that Athena holds the
weaver's shuttle, not merely as an instrument of texture, but as an instrument of picture;
the ideas of clothing, and of the warmth of life, being thus inseparably connected with those
of graphic beauty and the brightness of life. I have told you that no art could be recovered
among us without perfectness in dress, nor without the elementary graphic art of women, in
divers colours of needlework. There has been no nation of any art-energy, but has strenuously
occupied and interested itself in this household picturing, from the web of Penelope to the
tapestry of Queen Matilda, and the meshes of Arras and Gobelins.

106. We should then naturally ask what kind of embroidery Athena put on her own robe; "[Greek:
peplon heanon, poikilon hou r autê poiêsato kai kame chersin]."

The subject of that [Greek: poikilia] of hers, as you know, was the war of the giants and gods.
Now the real name of these giants, remember, is that used by Hesiod, "[Greek: pêlochonoi],"
"mud-begotten," and the meaning of the contest between these and Zeus, [Greek: pêlogonôn elatêr],
is, again, the inspiration of life into the clay, by the goddess of breath; and the actual
confusion going on visibly before you, daily, of the earth, heaping itself into cumbrous war
with the powers above it.

107. Thus briefly, the entire material of Art, under Athena's hand, is the contest of life
with clay; and all my task in explaining to you the early thought of both the Athenian and
Tuscan schools will only be the tracing of this battle of the giants into its full heroic form,
when, not in tapestry only--but in sculpture--and on the portal of the Temple of Delphi itself,
you have the "[Greek: klonos en teichesi lainoisi gigantôn]," and their defeat hailed by the
passionate cry of delight from the Athenian maids, beholding Pallas in her full power, "[Greek:
leussô Pallad' eman theon]," my own goddess. All our work, I repeat, will be nothing but the
inquiry into the development of this the subject, and the pressing fully home the question
of Plato about that embroidery--"And think you that there is verily war with each other among
the Gods? and dreadful enmities and battle, such as the poets have told, and such as our painters
set forth in graven scripture, to adorn all our sacred rites and holy places; yes, and in the
great Panathenaea themselves, the Peplus, full of such wild picturing, is carried up into the
Acropolis--shall we say that these things are true, oh Euthuphron, right-minded friend?"

108. Yes, we say, and know, that these things are true; and true for ever: battles of the gods,
not among themselves, but against the earth-giants. Battle prevailing age by age, in nobler
life and lovelier imagery; creation, which no theory of mechanism, no definition of force,
can explain, the adoption and completing of individual form by individual animation, breathed
out of the lips of the Father of Spirits. And to recognize the presence in every knitted shape
of dust, by which it lives and moves and has its being--to recognize it, revere, and show it
forth, is to be our eternal Idolatry.

"Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor worship them."

"Assuredly no," we answered once, in our pride; and through porch and aisle, broke down the
carved work thereof, with axes and hammers.

Who would have thought the day so near when we should bow down to worship, not the creatures,
but their atoms,--not the forces that form, but those that dissolve them? Trust me, gentlemen,
the command which is stringent against adoration of brutality, is stringent no less against
adoration of chaos, nor is faith in an image fallen from heaven to be reformed by a faith only
in the phenomenon of decadence. We have ceased from the making of monsters to be appeased by
sacrifice;--it is well,--if indeed we have also ceased from making them in our thoughts. We
have learned to distrust the adorning of fair phantasms, to which we once sought for succour;--it
is well, if we learn to distrust also the adorning of those to which we seek, for temptation;
but the verity of gains like these can only be known by our confession of the divine seal of
strength and beauty upon the tempered frame, and honour in the fervent heart, by which, increasing
visibly, may yet be manifested to us the holy presence, and the approving love, of the Loving
God, who visits the iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth
generation of them that hate Him, and shows mercy unto thousands in them that love Him, and
keep His Commandments.

Idolatry and Imagination in a more comprehensive sense; but here I use them for convenience
sake, limitedly, to avoid the continual occurrence of the terms, noble and ignoble, or false
and true, with reference to modes of conception.

LECTURE IV.

LIKENESS.

November, 1870.

109. You were probably vexed, and tired, towards the close of my last lecture, by the time
it took us to arrive at the apparently simple conclusion, that sculpture must only represent
organic form, and the strength of life in its contest with matter. But it is no small thing
to have that "[Greek: leussô Pallada]" fixed in your minds, as the one necessary sign by which
you are to recognize right sculpture, and believe me you will find it the best of all things,
if you can take for yourselves the saying from the lips of the Athenian maids, in its entirety,
and say also--[Greek: leussô Pallad' eman theon]. I proceed to-day into the practical appliance
of this apparently speculative, but in reality imperative, law.

110. You observe, I have hitherto spoken of the power of Athena, as over painting no less than
sculpture. But her rule over both arts is only so far as they are zoographic;--representative,
that is to say, of animal life, or of such order and discipline among other elements, as may
invigorate and purify it. Now there is a speciality of the art of painting beyond this, namely,
the representation of phenomena of colour and shadow, as such, without question of the nature
of the things that receive them. I am now accordingly obliged to speak of sculpture and painting
as distinct arts, but the laws which bind sculpture, bind no less the painting of the higher
schools which has, for its main purpose, the showing beauty in human or animal form; and which
is therefore placed by the Greeks equally under the rule of Athena, as the Spirit, first, of
Life, and then of Wisdom in conduct.

111. First, I say, you are to "see Pallas" in all such work, as the Queen of Life; and the
practical law which follows from this, is one of enormous range and importance, namely, that
nothing must be represented by sculpture, external to any living form, which does not help
to enforce or illustrate the conception of life. Both dress and armour may be made to do this,
by great sculptors, and are continually so used by the greatest. One of the essential distinctions
between the Athenian and Florentine schools is dependent on their treatment of drapery in this
respect; an Athenian always sets it to exhibit the action of the body, by flowing with it,
or over it, or from it, so as to illustrate both its form and gesture; a Florentine, on the
contrary, always uses his drapery to conceal or disguise the forms of the body, and exhibit
mental emotion: but both use it to enhance the life, either of the body or soul; Donatello
and Michael Angelo, no less than the sculptors of Gothic chivalry, ennoble armour in the same
way; but base sculptors carve drapery and armour for the sake of their folds and picturesqueness
only, and forget the body beneath. The rule is so stern that all delight in mere incidental
beauty, which painting often triumphs in, is wholly forbidden to sculpture;--for instance,
in painting the branch of a tree, you may rightly represent and enjoy the lichens and moss
on it, but a sculptor must not touch one of them: they are inessential to the tree's life,--he
must give the flow and bending of the branch only, else he does not enough "see Pallas" in it.

Or to take a higher instance, here is an exquisite little painted poem, by Edward Frere; a
cottage interior, one of the thousands which within the last two months[123] have been laid
desolate in unhappy France. Every accessory in the painting is of value--the fireside, the
tiled floor, the vegetables lying upon it, and the basket hanging from the roof. But not one
of these accessories would have been admissible in sculpture. You must carve nothing but what
has life. "Why"? you probably feel instantly inclined to ask me.--You see the principle we
have got, instead of being blunt or useless, is such an edged tool that you are startled the
moment I apply it. "Must we refuse every pleasant accessory and picturesque detail, and petrify
nothing but living creatures"?--Even so: I would not assert it on my own authority. It is the
Greeks who say it, but whatever they say of sculpture, be assured, is true.

112. That then is the first law--you must see Pallas as the Lady of Life--the second is, you
must see her as the Lady of Wisdom; or [Greek: sophia]--and this is the chief matter of all.
I cannot but think, that after the considerations into which we have now entered, you will
find more interest than hitherto in comparing the statements of Aristotle, in the Ethics, with
those of Plato in the Polity, which are authoritative as Greek definitions of goodness in art,
and which you may safely hold authoritative as constant definitions of it. You remember, doubtless,
that the [Greek: sophia] or [Greek: aretê technês], for the sake of which Phidias is called
[Greek: sophos] as a sculptor, and Polyclitus as an image-maker, Eth. 6. 7. (the opposition
is both between ideal and portrait sculpture, and between working in stone and bronze) consists
in the "[Greek: nous tôn timiôtatôn tê physei]" "the mental apprehension of the things that
are most honourable in their nature." Therefore what is, indeed, most lovely, the true image-maker
will most love; and what is most hateful, he will most hate, and in all things discern the
best and strongest part of them, and represent that essentially, or, if the opposite of that,
then with manifest detestation and horror. That is his art wisdom; the knowledge of good and
evil, and the love of good, so that you may discern, even in his representation of the vilest
thing, his acknowledgment of what redemption is possible for it, or latent power exists in
it; and, contrariwise, his sense of its present misery. But for the most part, he will idolize,
and force us also to idolize, whatever is living, and virtuous, and victoriously right; opposing
to it in some definite mode the image of the conquered [Greek: herpeton].

113. This is generally true of both the great arts; but in severity and precision, true of
sculpture. To return to our illustration: this poor little girl was more interesting to Edward
Frere, he being a painter, because she was poorly dressed, and wore these clumsy shoes, and
old red cap, and patched gown. May we sculpture her so? No. We may sculpture her naked, if
we like; but not in rags.

But if we may not put her into marble in rags, may we give her a pretty frock with ribands
and flounces to it, and put her into marble in that? No. We may put her simplest peasant's
dress, so it be perfect and orderly, into marble; anything finer than that would be more dishonourable
in the eyes of Athena than rags. If she were a French princess, you might carve her embroidered
robe and diadem; if she were Joan of Arc you might carve her armour--for then these also would
be "[Greek: tôn timiôtatôn]," not otherwise.

114. Is not this an edge-tool we have got hold of, unawares? and a subtle one too; so delicate
and scimitar-like in decision. For note, that even Joan of Arc's armour must be only sculptured,
if she has it on; it is not the honourableness or beauty of it that are enough, but the direct
bearing of it by her body. You might be deeply, even pathetically, interested by looking at
a good knight's dinted coat of mail, left in his desolate hall. May you sculpture it where
it hangs? No; the helmet for his pillow, if you will--no more.

You see we did not do our dull work for nothing in last lecture. I define what we have gained
once more, and then we will enter on our new ground.

115. The proper subject of sculpture, we have determined, is the spiritual power seen in the
form of any living thing, and so represented as to give evidence that the sculptor has loved
the good of it and hated the evil.

"So represented," we say; but how is that to be done? Why should it not be represented, if
possible, just as it is seen? What mode or limit of representation may we adopt? We are to
carve things that have life;--shall we try so to imitate them that they may indeed seem living,--or
only half living, and like stone instead of flesh?

It will simplify this question if I show you three examples of what the Greeks actually did:
three typical pieces of their sculpture, in order of perfection.

116. And now, observe that in all our historical work, I will endeavour to do, myself, what
I have asked you to do in your drawing exercises; namely, to outline firmly in the beginning,
and then fill in the detail more minutely. I will give you first, therefore, in a symmetrical
form, absolutely simple and easily remembered, the large chronology of the Greek school; within
that unforgettable scheme we will place, as we discover them, the minor relations of arts and
times.

I number the nine centuries before Christ thus, upwards, and divide them into three groups
of three each.

                          { 9
    A. ARCHAIC.           { 8
                          { 7
                          ----
                          { 6
    B. BEST.              { 5
                          { 4
                          ----
                          { 3
    C. CORRUPT.           { 2
                          { 1

Then the ninth, eighth, and seventh centuries are the period of Archaic Greek Art, steadily
progressive wherever it existed.

The sixth, fifth, and fourth are the period of central Greek Art; the fifth, or central century
producing the finest. That is easily recollected by the battle of Marathon. And the third,
second, and first centuries are the period of steady decline.

Learn this A B C thoroughly, and mark, for yourselves, what you, at present, think the vital
events in each century. As you know more, you will think other events the vital ones; but the
best historical knowledge only approximates to true thought in that matter; only be sure that
what is truly vital in the character which governs events, is always expressed by the art of
the century; so that if you could interpret that art rightly, the better part of your task
in reading history would be done to your hand.

117. It is generally impossible to date with precision art of the archaic period--often difficult
to date even that of the central three hundred years. I will not weary you with futile minor
divisions of time; here are three coins (Plate VII.) roughly, but decisively, characteristic
of the three ages. The first is an early coin of Tarentum. The city was founded as you know,
by the Spartan Phalanthus, late in the eighth century. I believe the head is meant for that
of Apollo Archegetes, it may however be Taras, the son of Poseidon; it is no matter to us at
present whom it is meant for, but the fact that we cannot know, is itself of the greatest import.
We cannot say, with any certainty, unless by discovery of some collateral evidence, whether
this head is intended for that of a god, or demi-god, or a mortal warrior. Ought not that to
disturb some of your thoughts respecting Greek idealism? Farther, if by investigation we discover
that the head is meant for that of Phalanthus, we shall know nothing of the character of Phalanthus
from the face; for there is no portraiture at this early time.

118. The second coin is of Ænus in Macedonia; probably of the fifth or early fourth century,
and entirely characteristic of the central period. This we know to represent the face of a
god--Hermes. The third coin is a king's, not a city's. I will not tell you, at this moment,
what king's; but only that it is a late coin of the third period, and that it is as distinct
in purpose as the coin of Tarentum is obscure. We know of this coin, that it represents no
god nor demi-god, but a mere mortal; and we know precisely, from the portrait, what that mortal's
face was like.

119. A glance at the three coins, as they are set side by side, will now show you the main
differences in the three great Greek styles. The archaic coin is sharp and hard; every line
decisive and numbered, set unhesitatingly in its place; nothing is wrong, though everything
incomplete, and, to us who have seen finer art, ugly. The central coin is as decisive and clear
in arrangement of masses, but its contours are completely rounded and finished. There is no
character in its execution so prominent that you can give an epithet to the style. It is not
hard, it is not soft, it is not delicate, it is not coarse, it is not grotesque, it is not
beautiful; and I am convinced, unless you had been told that this is fine central Greek art,
you would have seen nothing at all in it to interest you. Do not let yourselves be anywise
forced into admiring it; there is, indeed, nothing more here, than an approximately true rendering
of a healthy youthful face, without the slightest attempt to give an expression of activity,
cunning, nobility, or any other attribute of the Mercurial mind. Extreme simplicity, unpretending
vigour of work, which claims no admiration either for minuteness or dexterity, and suggests
no idea of effort at all; refusal of extraneous ornament, and perfectly arranged disposition
of counted masses in a sequent order, whether in the beads, or the ringlets of hair; this is
all you have to be pleased with; neither will you ever find, in the best Greek Art, more. You
might at first suppose that the chain of beads round the cap was an extraneous ornament; but
I have little doubt that it is as definitely the proper fillet for the head of Hermes, as the
olive for Zeus, or corn for Triptolemus. The cap or petasus cannot have expanded edges, there
is no room for them on the coin; these must be understood, therefore; but the nature of the
cloud-petasus is explained by edging it with beads, representing either dew or hail. The shield
of Athena often bears white pellets for hail, in like manner.

120. The third coin will, I think, at once strike you by what we moderns should call its "vigour
of character." You may observe also that the features are finished with great care and subtlety,
but at the cost of simplicity and breadth. But the essential difference between it and the
central art, is its disorder in design--you see the locks of hair cannot be counted any longer--they
are entirely dishevelled and irregular. Now the individual character may, or may not be, a
sign of decline; but the licentiousness, the casting loose of the masses in the design, is
an infallible one. The effort at portraiture is good for art if the men to be portrayed are
good men, not otherwise. In the instance before you, the head is that of Mithridates VI. of
Pontus, who had, indeed, the good qualities of being a linguist and a patron of the arts; but
as you will remember, murdered, according to report, his mother, certainly his brother, certainly
his wives and sisters, I have not counted how many of his children, and from a hundred to a
hundred and fifty thousand persons besides; these last in a single day's massacre. The effort
to represent this kind of person is not by any means a method of study from life ultimately
beneficial to art.

121. This however is not the point I have to urge to-day. What I want you to observe is that,
though the master of the great time does not attempt portraiture, he does attempt animation.
And as far as his means will admit, he succeeds in making the face--you might almost think--vulgarly
animated; as like a real face, literally, "as it can stare." Yes: and its sculptor meant it
to be so; and that was what Phidias meant his Jupiter to be, if he could manage it. Not, indeed,
to be taken for Zeus himself; and yet, to be as like a living Zeus as art could make it. Perhaps
you think he tried to make it look living only for the sake of the mob, and would not have
tried to do so for connoisseurs. Pardon me; for real connoisseurs, he would, and did; and herein
consists a truth which belongs to all the arts, and which I will at once drive home in your
minds, as firmly as I can.

122. All second-rate artists--(and remember, the second-rate ones are a loquacious multitude,
while the great come only one or two in a century; and then, silently)--all second-rate artists
will tell you that the object of fine art is not resemblance, but some kind of abstraction
more refined than reality. Put that out of your heads at once. The object of the great Resemblant
Arts is, and always has been, to resemble; and to resemble as closely as possible. It is the
function of a good portrait to set the man before you in habit as he lived, and I would we
had a few more that did so. It is the function of a good landscape to set the scene before
you in its reality, to make you, if it may be, think the clouds are flying, and the streams
foaming. It is the function of the best sculptor--the true Dædalus--to make stillness look
like breathing, and marble look like flesh.

123. And in all great times of art, this purpose is as naïvely expressed as it is steadily
held. All the talk about abstraction belongs to periods of decadence. In living times, people
see something living that pleases them; and they try to make it live for ever, or to make it
something as like it as possible, that will last for ever. They paint their statues, and inlay
the eyes with jewels, and set real crowns on their heads; they finish, in their pictures, every
thread of embroidery, and would fain, if they could, draw every leaf upon the trees. And their
only verbal expression of conscious success is, that they have made their work "look real."

124. You think all that very wrong. So did I, once; but it was I that was wrong. A long time
ago, before ever I had seen Oxford, I painted a picture of the Lake of Como, for my father.
It was not at all like the Lake of Como; but I thought it rather the better for that. My father
differed with me; and objected particularly to a boat with a red and yellow awning, which I
had put into the most conspicuous corner of my drawing. I declared this boat to be "necessary
to the composition." My father not the less objected, that he had never seen such a boat, either
at Como or elsewhere; and suggested that if I would make the lake look a little more like water,
I should be under no necessity of explaining its nature by the presence of floating objects.
I thought him at the time a very simple person for his pains; but have since learned, and it
is the very gist of all practical matters, which, as professor of fine art, I have now to tell
you, that the great point in painting a lake is--to get it to look like water.

125. So far, so good. We lay it down for a first principle, that our graphic art, whether painting
or sculpture, is to produce something which shall look as like Nature as possible. But now
we must go one step farther, and say that it is to produce what shall look like Nature to people
who know what Nature is like! You see this is at once a great restriction, as well as a great
exaltation of our aim. Our business is not to deceive the simple; but to deceive the wise!
Here, for instance, is a modern Italian print, representing, to the best of its power, St.
Cecilia, in a brilliantly realistic manner. And the fault of the work is not in its earnest
endeavour to show St. Cecilia in habit as she lived, but in that the effort could only be successful
with persons unaware of the habit St. Cecilia lived in. And this condition of appeal only to
the wise increases the difficulty of imitative resemblance so greatly, that, with only average
skill or materials, we must surrender all hope of it, and be content with an imperfect representation,
true as far as it reaches, and such as to excite the imagination of a wise beholder to complete
it; though falling very far short of what either he or we should otherwise have desired. For
instance, here is a suggestion, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, of the general appearance of a British
Judge--requiring the imagination of a very wise beholder indeed, to fill it up, or even at
first to discover what it is meant for. Nevertheless, it is better art than the Italian St.
Cecilia, because the artist, however little he may have done to represent his knowledge, does,
indeed, know altogether what a Judge is like, and appeals only to the criticism of those who
know also.

126. There must be, therefore, two degrees of truth to be looked for in the good graphic arts;
one, the commonest, which, by any partial or imperfect sign conveys to you an idea which you
must complete for yourself; and the other, the finest, a representation so perfect as to leave
you nothing to be farther accomplished by this independent exertion; but to give you the same
feeling of possession and presence which you would experience from the natural object itself.
For instance of the first, in this representation of a rainbow,[124] the artist has no hope
that, by the black lines of engraving, he can deceive you into any belief of the rainbow's
being there, but he gives indication enough of what he intends, to enable you to supply the
rest of the idea yourself, providing always you know beforehand what a rainbow is like. But
in this drawing of the falls of Terni,[125] the painter has strained his skill to the utmost
to give an actually deceptive resemblance of the iris, dawning and fading among the foam. So
far as he has not actually deceived you, it is not because he would not have done so if he
could; but only because his colours and science have fallen short of his desire. They have
fallen so little short that, in a good light, you may all but believe the foam and the sunshine
are drifting and changing among the rocks.

127. And after looking a little while, you will begin to regret that they are not so: you will
feel that, lovely as the drawing is, you would like far better to see the real place, and the
goats skipping among the rocks, and the spray floating above the fall. And this is the true
sign of the greatest art--to part voluntarily with its greatness;--to make itself poor and
unnoticed; but so to exalt and set forth its theme that you may be fain to see the theme instead
of it. So that you have never enough admired a great workman's doing till you have begun to
despise it. The best homage that could be paid to the Athena of Phidias would be to desire
rather to see the living goddess; and the loveliest Madonnas of Christian art fall short of
their due power, if they do not make their beholders sick at heart to see the living Virgin.

128. We have then, for our requirement of the finest art (sculpture, or anything else), that
it shall be so like the thing it represents as to please those who best know or can conceive
the original; and, if possible, please them deceptively--its final triumph being to deceive
even the wise; and (the Greeks thought) to please even the Immortals, who were so wise as to
be undeceivable. So that you get the Greek, thus far entirely true, idea of perfectness in
sculpture, expressed to you by what Phalaris says, at first sight of the bull of Perilaus,
"It only wanted motion and bellowing to seem alive; and as soon as I saw it, I cried out, it
ought to be sent to the god." To Apollo, for only he, the undeceivable, could thoroughly understand
such sculpture, and perfectly delight in it.

129. And with this expression of the Greek ideal of sculpture, I wish you to join the early
Italian, summed in a single line by Dante--"non vide me' di me, chi vide 'l vero." Read the
12th canto of the "Purgatory," and learn that whole passage by heart; and if ever you chance
to go to Pistoja, look at La Robbia's coloured porcelain bas-reliefs of the seven works of
Mercy on the front of the hospital there; and note especially the faces of the two sick men--one
at the point of death, and the other in the first peace and long-drawn breathing of health
after fever--and you will know what Dante meant by the preceding line, "Morti li morti, e i
vivi parèn vivi."

130. But now, may we not ask farther,--is it impossible for art such as this, prepared for
the wise, to please the simple also? Without entering on the awkward questions of degree, how
many the wise can be, or how much men should know, in order to be rightly called wise, may
we not conceive an art to be possible, which would deceive everybody, or everybody worth deceiving?
I showed you at my first lecture, a little ringlet of Japan ivory, as a type of elementary
bas-relief touched with colour; and in your rudimentary series you have a drawing by Mr. Burgess,
of one of the little fishes enlarged, with every touch of the chisel facsimiled on the more
visible scale; and showing the little black bead inlaid for the eye, which in the original
is hardly to be seen without a lens. You may, perhaps be surprised, when I tell you, that (putting
the question of subject aside for the moment, and speaking only of the mode of execution and
aim at resemblance), you have there a perfect example of the Greek ideal of method in sculpture.
And you will admit that, to the simplest person whom we could introduce as a critic, that fish
would be a satisfactory, nay, almost a deceptive fish; while to any one caring for subtleties
of art, I need not point out that every touch of the chisel is applied with consummate knowledge,
and that it would be impossible to convey more truth and life with the given quantity of workmanship.

131. Here is, indeed, a drawing by Turner, (Edu. 131), in which with some fifty times the quantity
of labour, and far more highly educated faculty of sight, the artist has expressed some qualities
of lustre and colour which only very wise persons indeed could perceive in a John Dory; and
this piece of paper contains, therefore, much more, and more subtle, art, than the Japan ivory;
but are we sure that it is therefore greater art? or that the painter was better employed in
producing this drawing, which only one person can possess, and only one in a hundred enjoy,
than he would have been in producing two or three pieces on a larger scale, which should have
been at once accessible to, and enjoyable by, a number of simpler persons? Suppose for instance,
that Turner, instead of faintly touching this outline, on white paper, with his camel's hair
pencil, had struck the main forms of his fish into marble, thus (Fig. 7): and instead of colouring
the white paper so delicately that, perhaps, only a few of the most keenly observant artists
in England can see it at all, had, with his strong hand, tinted the marble with a few colours,
deceptive to the people, and harmonious to the initiated; suppose that he had even conceded
so much to the spirit of popular applause as to allow of a bright glass bead being inlaid for
the eye, in the Japanese manner; and that the enlarged, deceptive, and popularly pleasing work
had been carved on the outside of a great building,--say Fishmongers' Hall,--where everybody
commercially connected with Billingsgate could have seen it, and ratified it with the wisdom
of the market;--might not the art have been greater, worthier, and kinder in such use?

132. Perhaps the idea does not once approve itself to you of having your public buildings covered
with ornaments like this; but pray, remember that the choice of subject is an ethical question,
not now before us. All I ask you to decide is whether the method is right, and would be pleasant
in giving the distinctiveness to pretty things, which it has here given to what, I suppose
it may be assumed, you feel to be an ugly thing. Of course, I must note parenthetically, such
realistic work is impossible in a country where the buildings are to be discoloured by coal-smoke;
but so is all fine sculpture, whatsoever; and the whiter, the worse its chance. For that which
is prepared for private persons, to be kept under cover, will, of necessity, degenerate into
the copyism of past work, or merely sensational and sensual forms of present life, unless there
be a governing school addressing the populace, for their instruction, on the outside of buildings.
So that, as I partly warned you in my third lecture, you can simply have no sculpture in a
coal country. Whether you like coals or carvings best, is no business of mine. I merely have
to assure you of the fact that they are incompatible.

But, assuming that we are again, some day, to become a civilized and governing race, deputing
ironmongery, coal-digging, and lucre-digging, to our slaves in other countries, it is quite
conceivable that, with an increasing knowledge of natural history, and desire for such knowledge,
what is now done by careful, but inefficient, woodcuts, and in ill-coloured engravings, might
be put in quite permanent sculptures, with inlay of variegated precious stones, on the outside
of buildings, where such pictures would be little costly to the people; and in a more popular
manner still, by Robbia ware and Palissy ware, and inlaid majolica, which would differ from
the housewives' present favourite decoration of plates above her kitchen dresser, by being
every piece of it various, instructive, and universally visible.

133. You hardly know, I suppose, whether I am speaking in jest or earnest. In the most solemn
earnest, I assure you; though such is the strange course of our popular life that all the irrational
arts of destruction are at once felt to be earnest; while any plan for those of instruction
on a grand scale, sounds like a dream or jest. Still, I do not absolutely propose to decorate
our public buildings with sculpture wholly of this character; though beast, and fowl, and creeping
things, and fishes, might all find room on such a building as the Solomon's House of a New
Atlantis; and some of them might even become symbolic of much to us again. Passing through
the Strand, only the other day, for instance, I saw four highly finished and delicately coloured
pictures of cock-fighting, which, for imitative quality, were nearly all that could be desired,
going far beyond the Greek cock of Himera; and they would have delighted a Greek's soul, if
they had meant as much as a Greek cock-fight; but they were only types of the "[Greek: endomachas
alektôr]," and of the spirit of home contest, which has been so fatal lately to the Bird of
France; and not of the defence of one's own barnyard, in thought of which the Olympians set
the cock on the pillars of their chariot course; and gave it goodly alliance in its battle,
as you may see here, in what is left of the angle of mouldering marble in the chair of the
priest of Dionusos. The cast of it, from the centre of the theatre under the Acropolis, is
in the British Museum; and I wanted its spiral for you, and this kneeling Angel of Victory;--it
is late Greek art, but nobly systematic flat bas-relief. So I set Mr. Burgess to draw it; but
neither he nor I for a little while, could make out what the Angel of Victory was kneeling
for. His attitude is an ancient and grandly conventional one among the Egyptians; and I was
tracing it back to a kneeling goddess of the greatest dynasty of the Pharaohs--a goddess of
Evening, or Death, laying down the sun out of her right hand;--when, one bright day, the shadows
came out clear on the Athenian throne, and I saw that my Angel of Victory was only backing
a cock at a cock-fight.

134. Still, as I have said, there is no reason why sculpture, even for simplest persons, should
confine itself to imagery of fish, or fowl, or four-footed things.

We go back to our first principle: we ought to carve nothing but what is honourable. And you
are offended, at this moment, with my fish, (as I believe, when the first sculptures appeared
on the windows of this museum, offence was taken at the unnecessary introduction of cats),
these dissatisfactions being properly felt by your "[Greek: nous tôn timiôtatôn]." For indeed,
in all cases, our right judgment must depend on our wish to give honour only to things and
creatures that deserve it.

135. And now I must state to you another principle of veracity, both in sculpture, and all
following arts, of wider scope than any hitherto examined. We have seen that sculpture is to
be a true representation of true external form. Much more is it to be a representation of true
internal emotion. You must carve only what you yourself see as you see it; but, much more,
you must carve only what you yourself feel, as you feel it. You may no more endeavour to feel
through other men's souls, than to see with other men's eyes. Whereas generally now in Europe
and America, every man's energy is bent upon acquiring some false emotion, not his own, but
belonging to the past, or to other persons, because he has been taught that such and such a
result of it will be fine. Every attempted sentiment in relation to art is hypocritical; our
notions of sublimity, of grace, or pious serenity, are all second hand; and we are practically
incapable of designing so much as a bell-handle or a door-knocker without borrowing the first
notion of it from those who are gone--where we shall not wake them with our knocking. I would
we could.

136. In the midst of this desolation we have nothing to count on for real growth, but what
we can find of honest liking and longing, in ourselves and in others. We must discover, if
we would healthily advance, what things are verily [Greek: timiôtata] among us; and if we delight
to honour the dishonourable, consider how, in future, we may better bestow our likings. Now
it appears to me from all our popular declarations, that we, at present, honour nothing so
much as liberty and independence; and no person so much as the Free man and Self-made man,
who will be ruled by no one, and has been taught, or helped, by no one. And the reason I chose
a fish for you as the first subject of sculpture, was that in men who are free and self-made,
you have the nearest approach, humanly possible, to the state of the fish, and finely organized
[Greek: herpeton]. You get the exact phrase in Habakkuk, if you take the Septuagint text.--"[Greek:
poiêseis tous anthrôpous hôs tous ichthyas tês thalassês, kai hôs ta herpeta ta ouk echonta
hêgoumenon."] "Thou wilt make men as the fishes of the sea, and as the reptile things, that
have no ruler over them." And it chanced that as I was preparing this lecture, one of our most
able and popular prints gave me a woodcut of the "self-made man," specified as such, so vigorously
drawn, and with so few touches, that Phidias or Turner himself could scarcely have done it
better; so that I had only to ask my assistant to enlarge it with accuracy, and it became comparable
with my fish at once. Of course it is not given by the caricaturist as an admirable face; only,
I am enabled by his skill to set before you, without any suspicion of unfairness on my part,
the expression to which the life we profess to think most honourable, naturally leads. If we
were to take the hat off, you see how nearly the profile corresponds with that of the typical fish.

137. Such, then, being the definition by your best popular art, of the ideal of feature at
which we are gradually arriving by self-manufacture; when I place opposite to it (in Plate
VIII.) the profile of a man not in any wise self-made, neither by the law of his own will,
nor by the love of his own interest--nor capable, for a moment, of any kind of "Independence,"
or of the idea of independence; but wholly dependent upon, and subjected to, external influence
of just law, wise teaching, and trusted love and truth, in his fellow-spirits;--setting before
you, I say, this profile of a God-made instead of a self-made, man, I know that you will feel,
on the instant, that you are brought into contact with the vital elements of human art; and
that this, the sculpture of the good, is indeed the only permissible sculpture.

138. A God-made man, I say. The face, indeed, stands as a symbol of more than man in its sculptor's
mind. For as I gave you, to lead your first effort in the form of leaves, the sceptre of Apollo,
so this, which I give you as the first type of rightness in the form of flesh, is the countenance
of the holder of that sceptre, the Sun-God of Syracuse. But there is nothing in the face (nor
did the Greek suppose there was) more perfect than might be seen in the daily beauty of the
creatures the Sun-God shone upon, and whom his strength and honour animated. This is not an
ideal, but a quite literally true, face of a Greek youth; nay, I will undertake to show you
that it is not supremely beautiful, and even to surpass it altogether with the literal portrait
of an Italian one. It is in verity no more than the form habitually taken by the features of
a well educated young Athenian or Sicilian citizen; and the one requirement for the sculptors
of to-day is not, as it has been thought, to invent the same ideal, but merely to see the same
reality.

Now, you know I told you in my fourth lecture, that the beginning of art was in getting our
country clean and our people beautiful, and you supposed that to be a statement irrelevant
to my subject; just as, at this moment, you perhaps think, I am quitting the great subject
of this present lecture--the method of likeness-making--and letting myself branch into the
discussion of what things we are to make likeness of. But you shall see hereafter that the
method of imitating a beautiful thing must be different from the method of imitating an ugly
one; and that, with the change in subject from what is dishonourable to what is honourable,
there will be involved a parallel change in the management of tools, of lines, and of colours.
So that before I can determine for you how you are to imitate, you must tell me what kind of
face you wish to imitate. The best draughtsmen in the world could not draw this Apollo in ten
scratches, though he can draw the self-made man. Still less this nobler Apollo of Ionian Greece,
(Plate IX.) in which the incisions are softened into a harmony like that of Correggio's painting.
So that you see the method itself,--the choice between black incision or fine sculpture, and
perhaps, presently, the choice between colour or no colour, will depend on what you have to
represent. Colour may be expedient for a glistening dolphin or a spotted fawn;--perhaps inexpedient
for white Poseidon, and gleaming Dian. So that, before defining the laws of sculpture, I am
compelled to ask you, what you mean to carve; and that, little as you think it, is asking you
how you mean to live, and what the laws of your State are to be, for they determine those of
your statue. You can only have this kind of face to study from, in the sort of state that produced
it. And you will find that sort of state described in the beginning of the fourth book of the
laws of Plato; as founded, for one thing, on the conviction that of all the evils that can
happen to a state, quantity of money is the greatest! [Greek: meizon kakon, ôs epos eipein,
polei ouden an gignoito, eis gennaiôn kai dikaiôn êthôn ktêsin], "for, to speak shortly, no
greater evil, matching each against each, can possibly happen to a city, as adverse to its
forming just or generous character," than its being full of silver and gold.

139. Of course, the Greek notion may be wrong, and ours right, only--[Greek: ôs epos eipein]--you
can have Greek sculpture only on that Greek theory: shortly expressed by the words put into
the mouth of Poverty herself, in the Plutus of Aristophanes "[Greek: Tou ploutou parechô beltionas
andras, kai tên gnômên, kai tên idean]," "I deliver to you better men than the God of Money
can, both in imagination and feature." So on the other hand, this ichthyoid, reptilian, or
mono-chondyloid ideal of the self-made man can only be reached, universally, by a nation which
holds that poverty, either of purse or spirit,--but especially the spiritual character of being
[Greek: ptôchoi tô pneumati], is the lowest of degradations; and which believes that the desire
of wealth is the first of manly and moral sentiments. As I have been able to get the popular
ideal represented by its own living art, so I can give you this popular faith in its own living
words; but in words meant seriously and not at all as caricature, from one of our leading journals,
professedly æsthetic also in its very name, the Spectator, of August 6th, 1870.

"Mr. Ruskin's plan," it says, "would make England poor, in order that she might be cultivated,
and refined and artistic. A wilder proposal was never broached by a man of ability; and it
might be regarded as a proof that the assiduous study of art emasculates the intellect, and
even the moral sense. Such a theory almost warrants the contempt with which art is often regarded
by essentially intellectual natures, like Proudhon" (sic). "Art is noble as the flower of life,
and the creations of a Titian are a great heritage of the race; but if England could secure
high art and Venetian glory of colour only by the sacrifice of her manufacturing supremacy,
and by the acceptance of national poverty, then the pursuit of such artistic achievements would
imply that we had ceased to possess natures of manly strength, or to know the meaning of moral
aims. If we must choose between a Titian and a Lancashire cotton mill, then, in the name of
manhood and of morality, give us the cotton mill. Only the dilettantism of the studio; that
dilettantism which loosens the moral no less than the intellectual fibre, and which is as fatal
to rectitude of action as to correctness of reasoning power, would make a different choice."

You see also, by this interesting and most memorable passage, how completely the question is
admitted to be one of ethics--the only real point at issue being, whether this face or that
is developed on the truer moral principle.

140. I assume, however, for the present, that this Apolline type is the kind of form you wish
to reach and to represent. And now observe, instantly, the whole question of manner of imitation
is altered for us. The fins of the fish, the plumes of the swan, and the flowing of the Sun-God's
hair are all represented by incisions--but the incisions do sufficiently represent the fin
and feather,--they insufficiently represent the hair. If I chose, with a little more care and
labor, I could absolutely get the surface of the scales and spines of the fish, and the expression
of its mouth; but no quantity of labor would obtain the real surface of a tress of Apollo's
hair, and the full expression of his mouth. So that we are compelled at once to call the imagination
to help us, and say to it, You know what the Apollo Chrysocomes must be like; finish all this
for yourself. Now, the law under which imagination works, is just that of other good workers.
"You must give me clear orders; show me what I have to do, and where I am to begin, and let
me alone." And the orders can be given, quite clearly, up to a certain point, in form; but
they cannot be given clearly in color, now that the subject is subtle. All beauty of this high
kind depends on harmony; let but the slightest discord come into it, and the finer the thing
is, the more fatal will be the flaw. Now, on a flat surface, I can command my color to be precisely
what and where I mean it to be; on a round one I cannot. For all harmony depends, first, on
the fixed proportion of the color of the light to that of the relative shadow; and therefore
if I fasten my color, I must fasten my shade. But on a round surface the shadow changes at
every hour of the day; and therefore all coloring which is expressive of form, is impossible;
and if the form is fine, (and here there is nothing but what is fine,) you may bid farewell
to color.

141. Farewell to color; that is to say, if the thing is to be seen distinctly, and you have
only wise people to show it to; but if it is to be seen indistinctly, at a distance, color
may become explanatory; and if you have simple people to show it to, color may be necessary
to excite their imaginations, though not to excite yours. And the art is great always by meeting
its conditions in the straightest way; and if it is to please a multitude of innocent and bluntly-minded
persons, must express itself in the terms that will touch them; else it is not good. And I
have to trace for you through the history of the past, and possibilities of the future, the
expedients used by great sculptors to obtain clearness, impressiveness, or splendor; and the
manner of their appeal to the people, under various light and shadow, and with reference to
different degrees of public intelligence: such investigation resolving itself again and again,
as we proceed, into questions absolutely ethical; as, for instance, whether color is to be
bright or dull,--that is to say, for a populace cheerful or heartless;--whether it is to be
delicate or strong,--that is to say, for a populace attentive or careless; whether it is to
be a background like the sky, for a procession of young men and maidens, because your populace
revere life--or the shadow of the vault behind a corpse stained with drops of blackened blood,
for a populace taught to worship Death. Every critical determination of rightness depends on
the obedience to some ethic law, by the most rational and, therefore, simplest means. And you
see how it depends most, of all things, on whether you are working for chosen persons, or for
the mob; for the joy of the boudoir, or of the Borgo. And if for the mob, whether the mob of
Olympia, or of St. Antoine. Phidias, showing his Jupiter for the first time, hides behind the
temple door to listen, resolved afterwards "[Greek: rhythmizein to agalma pros to tois pleistois
dokoun, ou gar hêgeito mikran einai symboulên dêmou tosoutou]," and truly, as your people is,
in judgment, and in multitude, so must your sculpture be, in glory. An elementary principle
which has been too long out of mind.

142. I leave you to consider it, since, for some time, we shall not again be able to take up
the inquiries to which it leads. But, ultimately, I do not doubt that you will rest satisfied
in these following conclusions:

1. Not only sculpture, but all the other fine arts, must be for the people.

2. They must be didactic to the people, and that as their chief end. The structural arts, didactic
in their manner; the graphic arts, in their matter also.

3. And chiefly the great representative and imaginative arts--that is to say, the drama and
sculpture--are to teach what is noble in past history, and lovely in existing human and organic
life.

4. And the test of right manner of execution in these arts, is that they strike, in the most
emphatic manner, the rank of popular minds to which they are addressed.

5. And the test of utmost fineness in execution in these arts, is that they make themselves
be forgotten in what they represent; and so fulfil the words of their greatest Master,

    "THE BEST, IN THIS KIND, ARE BUT SHADOWS."

LECTURE V.

STRUCTURE.

December, 1870.

143. On previous occasions of addressing you, I have endeavoured to show you, first, how sculpture
is distinguished from other arts; then its proper subjects, then its proper method in the realization
of these subjects. To-day, we must, in the fourth place, consider the means at its command
for the accomplishment of these ends; the nature of its materials; and the mechanical or other
difficulties of their treatment.

And however doubtful we may have remained, as to the justice of Greek ideals, or propriety
of Greek methods of representing them, we may be certain that the example of the Greeks will
be instructive in all practical matters relating to this great art, peculiarly their own. I
think even the evidence I have already laid before you is enough to convince you, that it was
by rightness and reality, not by idealism or delightfulness only, that their minds were finally
guided; and I am sure that, before closing the present course, I shall be able so far to complete
that evidence, as to prove to you that the commonly received notions of classic art are, not
only unfounded, but even in many respects, directly contrary to the truth. You are constantly
told that Greece idealized whatever she contemplated. She did the exact contrary: she realized
and verified it. You are constantly told she sought only the beautiful. She sought, indeed,
with all her heart; but she found, because she never doubted that the search was to be consistent
with propriety and common sense. And the first thing you will always discern in Greek work
is the first which you ought to discern in all work; namely, that the object of it has been
rational, and has been obtained by simple and unostentatious means.

144. "That the object of the work has been rational!" Consider how much that implies. That
it should be by all means seen to have been determined upon, and carried through, with sense
and discretion; these being gifts of intellect far more precious than any knowledge of mathematics,
or of the mechanical resources of art. Therefore, also, that it should be a modest and temperate
work, a structure fitted to the actual state of men; proportioned to their actual size, as
animals,--to their average strength,--to their true necessities,--and to the degree of easy
command they have over the forces and substances of nature.

145. You see how much this law excludes! All that is fondly magnificent, insolently ambitious,
or vainly difficult. There is, indeed, such a thing as Magnanimity in design, but never unless
it be joined also with modesty and Equanimity. Nothing extravagant, monstrous, strained, or
singular, can be structurally beautiful. No towers of Babel envious of the skies; no pyramids
in mimicry of the mountains of the earth; no streets that are a weariness to traverse, nor
temples that make pigmies of the worshippers.

It is one of the primal merits and decencies of Greek work that it was, on the whole, singularly
small in scale, and wholly within reach of sight, to its finest details. And, indeed, the best
buildings that I know are thus modest; and some of the best are minute jewel cases for sweet
sculpture. The Parthenon would hardly attract notice, if it were set by the Charing Cross Railway
Station: the Church of the Miracoli, at Venice, the Chapel of the Rose, at Lucca, and the Chapel
of the Thorn, at Pisa, would not, I suppose, all three together, fill the tenth part, cube,
of a transept of the Crystal Palace. And they are better so.

146. In the chapter on Power in the "Seven Lamps of Architecture," I have stated what seems,
at first, the reverse of what I am saying now; namely, that it is better to have one grand
building than any number of mean ones. And that is true, but you cannot command grandeur by
size till you can command grace in minuteness; and least of all, remember, will you so command
it to-day, when magnitude has become the chief exponent of folly and misery, co-ordinate in
the fraternal enormities of the Factory and Poorhouse,--the Barracks and Hospital. And the
final law in this matter is, that if you require edifices only for the grace and health of
mankind, and build them without pretence and without chicanery, they will be sublime on a modest
scale, and lovely with little decoration.

147. From these principles of simplicity and temperance, two very severely fixed laws of construction
follow; namely, first, that our structure, to be beautiful, must be produced with tools of
men; and secondly, that it must be composed of natural substances. First, I say, produced with
tools of men. All fine art requires the application of the whole strength and subtlety of the
body, so that such art is not possible to any sickly person, but involves the action and force
of a strong man's arm from the shoulder, as well as the delicatest touch of his finger: and
it is the evidence that this full and fine strength has been spent on it which makes the art
executively noble; so that no instrument must be used, habitually, which is either too heavy
to be delicately restrained, or too small and weak to transmit a vigorous impulse; much less
any mechanical aid, such as would render the sensibility of the fingers ineffectual.[126]

148. Of course, any kind of work in glass, or in metal, on a large scale, involves some painful
endurance of heat; and working in clay, some habitual endurance of cold; but the point beyond
which the effort must not be carried is marked by loss of power of manipulation. As long as
the eyes and fingers have complete command of the material (as a glass blower has, for instance,
in doing fine ornamental work)--the law is not violated; but all our great engine and furnace
work, in gun-making and the like, is degrading to the intellect; and no nation can long persist
in it without losing many of its human faculties. Nay, even the use of machinery, other than
the common rope and pully, for the lifting of weights, is degrading to architecture; the invention
of expedients for the raising of enormous stones has always been a characteristic of partly
savage or corrupted races. A block of marble not larger than a cart with a couple of oxen could
carry, and a cross-beam, with a couple of pulleys, raise, is as large as should generally be
used in any building. The employment of large masses is sure to lead to vulgar exhibitions
of geometrical arrangement,[127] and to draw away the attention from the sculpture. In general,
rocks naturally break into such pieces as the human beings that have to build with them can
easily lift, and no larger should be sought for.

149. In this respect, and in many other subtle ways, the law that the work is to be with tools
of men is connected with the farther condition of its modesty, that it is to be wrought in
substance provided by Nature, and to have a faithful respect to all the essential qualities
of such substance.

And here I must ask your attention to the idea, and, more than idea,--the fact, involved in
that infinitely misused term, "Providentia," when applied to the Divine Power. In its truest
sense and scholarly use, it is a human virtue, [Greek: Promêtheia]; the personal type of it
is in Prometheus, and all the first power of [Greek: technê], is from him, as compared to the
weakness of days when men without foresight "[Greek: ephyron eikê panta]." But, so far as we
use the word "Providence" as an attribute of the Maker and Giver of all things, it does not
mean that in a shipwreck He takes care of the passengers who are to be saved and takes none
of those who are to be drowned; but it does mean that every race of creatures is born into
the world under circumstances of approximate adaptation to its necessities; and, beyond all
others, the ingenious and observant race of man is surrounded with elements naturally good
for his food, pleasant to his sight, and suitable for the subjects of his ingenuity;--the stone,
metal, and clay of the earth he walks upon lending themselves at once to his hand, for all
manner of workmanship.

150. Thus, his truest respect for the law of the entire creation is shown by his making the
most of what he can get most easily; and there is no virtue of art, nor application of common
sense, more sacredly necessary than this respect to the beauty of natural substance, and the
ease of local use; neither are there any other precepts of construction so vital as these--that
you show all the strength of your material, tempt none of its weaknesses, and do with it only
what can be simply and permanently done.

151. Thus, all good building will be with rocks, or pebbles, or burnt clay, but with no artificial
compound; all good painting, with common oils and pigments on common canvas, paper, plaster,
or wood,--admitting, sometimes for precious work, precious things, but all applied in a simple
and visible way. The highest imitative art should not, indeed, at first sight, call attention
to the means of it; but even that, at length, should do so distinctly, and provoke the observer
to take pleasure in seeing how completely the workman is master of the particular material
he has used, and how beautiful and desirable a substance it was, for work of that kind. In
oil painting its unctious quality is to be delighted in; in fresco, its chalky quality; in
glass, its transparency; in wood, its grain; in marble, its softness; in porphyry, its hardness;
in iron, its toughness. In a flint country, one should feel the delightfulness of having flints
to pick up, and fasten together into rugged walls. In a marble country one should be always
more and more astonished at the exquisite colour and structure of marble; in a slate country
one should feel as if every rock cleft itself only for the sake of being built with conveniently.

152. Now, for sculpture, there are, briefly, two materials--Clay, and Stone; for glass is only
a clay that gets clear and brittle as it cools, and metal a clay that gets opaque and tough
as it cools. Indeed, the true use of gold in this world is only as a very pretty and very ductile
clay, which you can spread as flat as you like, spin as fine as you like, and which will neither
crack, nor tarnish.

All the arts of sculpture in clay may be summed up under the word "Plastic," and all of those
in stone, under the word "Glyptic."

153. Sculpture in clay will accordingly include all cast brick-work, pottery, and tile-work[128]--a
somewhat important branch of human skill. Next to the potter's work, you have all the arts
in porcelain, glass, enamel, and metal; everything, that is to say, playful and familiar in
design, much of what is most felicitously inventive, and, in bronze or gold, most precious
and permanent.

154. Sculpture in stone, whether granite, gem, or marble, while we accurately use the general
term "glyptic" for it, may be thought of with, perhaps, the most clear force under the English
word "engraving." For, from the mere angular incision which the Greek consecrated in the triglyphs
of his greatest order of architecture, grow forth all the arts of bas-relief, and methods of
localized groups of sculpture connected with each other and with architecture: as, in another
direction, the arts of engraving and wood-cutting themselves.

155. Over all this vast field of human skill the laws which I have enunciated to you rule with
inevitable authority, embracing the greatest, and consenting to the humblest, exertion; strong
to repress the ambition of nations, if fantastic and vain, but gentle to approve the efforts
of children, made in accordance with the visible intention of the Maker of all flesh, and the
Giver of all Intelligence. These laws, therefore, I now repeat, and beg of you to observe them
as irrefragable.

1. That the work is to be with tools of men.

2. That it is to be in natural materials.

3. That it is to exhibit the virtues of those materials, and aim at no quality inconsistent
with them.

4. That its temper is to be quiet and gentle, in harmony with common needs, and in consent
to common intelligence.

We will now observe the bearing of these laws on the elementary conditions of the art at present
under discussion.

156. There is, first, work in baked clay, which contracts as it dries, and is very easily frangible.
Then you must put no work into it requiring niceness in dimension, nor any so elaborate that
it would be a great loss if it were broken, but as the clay yields at once to the hand, and
the sculptor can do anything with it he likes, it is a material for him to sketch with and
play with,--to record his fancies in, before they escape him--and to express roughly, for people
who can enjoy such sketches, what he has not time to complete in marble. The clay, being ductile,
lends itself to all softness of line; being easily frangible, it would be ridiculous to give
it sharp edges, so that a blunt and massive rendering of graceful gesture will be its natural
function; but as it can be pinched, or pulled, or thrust in a moment into projection which
it would take hours of chiselling to get in stone, it will also properly be used for all fantastic
and grotesque form, not involving sharp edges. Therefore, what is true of chalk and charcoal,
for painters, is equally true of clay, for sculptors; they are all most precious materials
for true masters, but tempt the false ones into fatal license; and to judge rightly of terra-cotta
work is a far higher reach of skill in sculpture-criticism than to distinguish the merits of
a finished statue.

157. We have, secondly, work in bronze, iron, gold, and other metals; in which the laws of
structure are still more definite.

All kinds of twisted and wreathen work on every scale become delightful when wrought in ductile
or tenacious metal, but metal which is to be hammered into form separates itself into two great
divisions--solid, and flat.

(A.) In solid metal work, i. e., metal cast thick enough to resist bending, whether it be hollow
or not, violent and various projection may be admitted, which would be offensive in marble;
but no sharp edges, because it is difficult to produce them with the hammer. But since the
permanence of the material justifies exquisiteness of workmanship, whatever delicate ornamentation
can be wrought with rounded surfaces may be advisedly introduced; and since the colour of bronze
or any other metal is not so pleasantly representative of flesh as that of marble, a wise sculptor
will depend less on flesh contour, and more on picturesque accessories, which, though they
would be vulgar if attempted in stone, are rightly entertaining in bronze or silver. Verrochio's
statue of Colleone at Venice, Cellini's Perseus at Florence, and Ghiberti's gates at Florence,
are models of bronze treatment.

(B.) When metal is beaten thin, it becomes what is technically called "plate," (the flattened
thing) and may be treated advisably in two ways; one, by beating it out into bosses, the other
by cutting it into strips and ramifications. The vast schools of goldsmith's work and of iron
decoration, founded on these two principles, have had the most powerful influences over general
taste in all ages and countries. One of the simplest and most interesting elementary examples
of the treatment of flat metal by cutting is the common branched iron bar, Fig. 8, used to
close small apertures in countries possessing any good primitive style of iron-work, formed
by alternate cuts on its sides, and the bending down of the several portions. The ordinary
domestic window balcony of Verona is formed by mere ribands of iron, bent into curves as studiously
refined as those of a Greek vase, and decorated merely by their own terminations in spiral volutes.

All cast work in metal, unfinished by hand, is inadmissible in any school of living art, since
it cannot possess the perfection of form due to a permanent substance; and the continual sight
of it is destructive of the faculty of taste: but metal stamped with precision, as in coins,
is to sculpture what engraving is to painting.

158. Thirdly. Stone-sculpture divides itself into three schools: one in very hard material;
one in very soft, and one in that of centrally useful consistence.

A. The virtue of work in hard material is the expression of form in shallow relief, or in broad
contours; deep cutting in hard material is inadmissible, and the art, at once pompous and trivial,
of gem engraving, has been in the last degree destructive of the honour and service of sculpture.

B. The virtue of work in soft material is deep cutting, with studiously graceful disposition
of the masses of light and shade. The greater number of flamboyant churches of France are cut
out of an adhesive chalk; and the fantasy of their latest decoration was, in great part, induced
by the facility of obtaining contrast of black space, undercut, with white tracery easily left
in sweeping and interwoven rods--the lavish use of wood in domestic architecture materially
increasing the habit of delight in branched complexity of line. These points, however, I must
reserve for illustration in my lectures on architecture. To-day, I shall limit myself to the
illustration of elementary sculptural structure in the best material;--that is to say, in crystalline
marble, neither soft enough to encourage the caprice of the workman, nor hard enough to resist
his will.

159. C. By the true "Providence" of Nature, the rock which is thus submissive has been in some
places stained with the fairest colours, and in others blanched into the fairest absence of
colour, that can be found to give harmony to inlaying, or dignity to form. The possession by
the Greeks of their [Greek: leukos lithos] was indeed the first circumstance regulating the
development of their art; it enabled them at once to express their passion for light by executing
the faces, hands, and feet of their dark wooden statues in white marble, so that what we look
upon only with pleasure for fineness of texture was to them an imitation of the luminous body
of the deity shining from behind its dark robes; and ivory afterwards is employed in their
best statues for its yet more soft and flesh-like brightness, receptive also of the most delicate
colour--(therefore to this day the favourite ground of miniature painters). In like manner,
the existence of quarries of peach-coloured marble within twelve miles of Verona, and of white
marble and green serpentine between Pisa and Genoa, defined the manner both of sculpture and
architecture for all the Gothic buildings of Italy. No subtlety of education could have formed
a high school of art without these materials.

160. Next to the colour, the fineness of substance which will take a perfectly sharp edge,
is essential; and this not merely to admit fine delineation in the sculpture itself, but to
secure a delightful precision in placing the blocks of which it is composed. For the possession
of too fine marble, as far as regards the work itself, is a temptation instead of an advantage
to an inferior sculptor; and the abuse of the facility of undercutting, especially of undercutting
so as to leave profiles defined by an edge against shadow, is one of the chief causes of decline
of style in such encrusted bas-reliefs as those of the Certosa of Pavia and its contemporary
monuments. But no undue temptation ever exists as to the fineness of block fitting; nothing
contributes to give so pure and healthy a tone to sculpture as the attention of the builder
to the jointing of his stones; and his having both the power to make them fit so perfectly
as not to admit of the slightest portion of cement showing externally, and the skill to insure,
if needful, and to suggest always, their stability in cementless construction. Plate X. represents
a piece of entirely fine Lombardic building, the central portion of the arch in the Duomo of
Verona, which corresponds to that of the porch of San Zenone, represented in Plate I. In both
these pieces of building, the only line that traces the architrave round the arch, is that
of the masonry joint; yet this line is drawn with extremest subtlety, with intention of delighting
the eye by its relation of varied curvature to the arch itself; and it is just as much considered
as the finest pen-line of a Raphael drawing. Every joint of the stone is used, in like manner,
as a thin black line, which the slightest sign of cement would spoil like a blot. And so proud
is the builder of his fine jointing, and so fearless of any distortion or strain spoiling the
adjustment afterwards, that in one place he runs his joint quite gratuitously through a bas-relief,
and gives the keystone its only sign of pre-eminence by the minute inlaying of the head of
the Lamb, into the stone of the course above.

161. Proceeding from this fine jointing to fine draughtsmanship, you have, in the very outset
and earliest stage of sculpture, your flat stone surface given you as a sheet of white paper,
on which you are required to produce the utmost effect you can with the simplest means, cutting
away as little of the stone as may be, to save both time and trouble; and, above all, leaving
the block itself, when shaped, as solid as you can, that its surface may better resist weather,
and the carved parts be as much protected as possible by the masses left around them.

162. The first thing to be done is clearly to trace the outline of subject with an incision
approximating in section to that of the furrow of a plough, only more equal-sided. A fine sculptor
strikes it, as his chisel leans, freely, on marble; an Egyptian, in hard rock, cuts it sharp,
as in cuneiform inscriptions. In any case, you have a result somewhat like the upper figure,
Plate XI., in which I show you the most elementary indication of form possible, by cutting
the outline of the typical archaic Greek head with an incision like that of a Greek triglyph,
only not so precise in edge or slope, as it is to be modified afterwards.

163. Now, the simplest thing we can do next, is to round off the flat surface within the incision,
and put what form we can get into the feebler projection of it thus obtained. The Egyptians
do this, often with exquisite skill, and then, as I showed you in a former lecture, colour
the whole--using the incision as an outline. Such a method of treatment is capable of good
service in representing, at little cost of pains, subjects in distant effect, and common, or
merely picturesque, subjects even near. To show you what it is capable of, and what coloured
sculpture would be in its rudest type, I have prepared the coloured relief of the John Dory[129]
as a natural history drawing for distant effect. You know, also, that I meant him to be ugly--as
ugly as any creature can well be. In time, I hope to show you prettier things--peacocks and
kingfishers,--butterflies and flowers, on grounds of gold, and the like, as they were in Byzantine
work. I shall expect you, in right use of your æsthetic faculties, to like those better than
what I show you to-day. But it is now a question of method only; and if you will look, after
the lecture, first at the mere white relief, and then see how much may be gained by a few dashes
of colour, such as a practised workman could lay in a quarter of an hour,--the whole forming,
if well done, almost a deceptive image--you will, at least, have the range of power in Egyptian
sculpture clearly expressed to you.

164. But for fine sculpture, we must advance by far other methods. If we carve the subject
with real delicacy, the cast shadow of the incision will interfere with its outline, so that,
for representation of beautiful things, you must clear away the ground about it, at all events
for a little distance. As the law of work is to use the least pains possible, you clear it
only just as far back as you need, and then for the sake of order and finish, you give the
space a geometrical outline. By taking, in this case, the simplest I can,--a circle,--I can
clear the head with little labor in the removal of surface round it; (see the lower figure
in Plate XI.)

165. Now, these are the first terms of all well-constructed bas-relief. The mass you have to
treat consists of a piece of stone, which, however you afterwards carve it, can but, at its
most projecting point, reach the level of the external plane surface out of which it was mapped,
and defined by a depression round it; that depression being at first a mere trench, then a
moat of certain width, of which the outer sloping bank is in contact, as a limiting geometrical
line, with the laterally salient portions of sculpture. This, I repeat, is the primal construction
of good bas-relief, implying, first, perfect protection to its surface from any transverse
blow, and a geometrically limited space to be occupied by the design, into which it shall pleasantly
(and as you shall ultimately see, ingeniously,) contract itself: implying, secondly, a determined
depth of projection, which it shall rarely reach, and never exceed: and implying, finally,
the production of the whole piece with the least possible labor of chisel and loss of stone.

166. And these, which are the first, are very nearly the last constructive laws of sculpture.
You will be surprised to find how much they include, and how much of minor propriety in treatment
their observance involves.

In a very interesting essay on the architecture of the Parthenon, by the professor of architecture
of the Ecole Polytechnique, M. Emile Boutmy, you will find it noticed that the Greeks do not
usually weaken, by carving, the constructive masses of their building; but put their chief
sculpture in the empty spaces between the triglyphs, or beneath the roof. This is true; but
in so doing, they merely build their panel instead of carving it; they accept no less than
the Goths, the laws of recess and limitation, as being vital to the safety and dignity of their
design; and their noblest recumbent statues are, constructively, the fillings of the acute
extremity of a panel in the form of an obtusely summitted triangle.

167. In gradual descent from that severest type, you will find that an immense quantity of
sculpture of all times and styles may be generally embraced under the notion of a mass hewn
out of, or, at least, placed in, a panel or recess, deepening, it may be, into a niche; the
sculpture being always designed with reference to its position in such recess; and, therefore,
to the effect of the building out of which the recess is hewn.

But, for the sake of simplifying our inquiry, I will at first suppose no surrounding protective
ledge to exist, and that the area of stone we have to deal with is simply a flat slab, extant
from a flat surface depressed all round it.

168. A flat slab, observe. The flatness of surface is essential to the problem of bas-relief.
The lateral limit of the panel may, or may not, be required; but the vertical limit of surface
must be expressed; and the art of bas-relief is to give the effect of true form on that condition.
For observe, if nothing more were needed than to make first a cast of a solid form, then cut
it in half, and apply the half of it to the flat surface;--if, for instance, to carve a bas-relief
of an apple, all I had to do was to cut my sculpture of the whole apple in half, and pin it
to the wall, any ordinary trained sculptor, or even a mechanical workman, could produce bas-relief;
but the business is to carve a round thing out of flat thing; to carve an apple out of a biscuit!--to
conquer, as a subtle Florentine has here conquered,[130] his marble, so as not only to get
motion into what is most rigidly fixed, but to get boundlessness into what is most narrowly
bounded; and carve Madonna and Child, rolling clouds, flying angels, and space of heavenly
air behind all, out of a film of stone not the third of an inch thick where it is thickest.

169. Carried, however, to such a degree of subtlety as this, and with so ambitious and extravagant
aim, bas-relief becomes a tour-de-force; and, you know, I have just told you all tours-de-force
are wrong. The true law of bas-relief is to begin with a depth of incision proportioned justly
to the distance of the observer and the character of the subject, and out of that rationally
determined depth, neither increased for ostentation of effect, nor diminished for ostentation
of skill, to do the utmost that will be easily visible to an observer, supposing him to give
an average human amount of attention, but not to peer into, or critically scrutinize the work.

170. I cannot arrest you to-day by the statement of any of the laws of sight and distance which
determine the proper depth of bas-relief. Suppose that depth fixed; then observe what a pretty
problem, or, rather, continually varying cluster of problems, will be offered to us. You might,
at first, imagine that, given what we may call our scale of solidity, or scale of depth, the
diminution from nature would be in regular proportion, as for instance, if the real depth of
your subject be, suppose a foot, and the depth of your bas-relief an inch, then the parts of
the real subject which were six inches round the side of it would be carved, you might imagine,
at the depth of half-an-inch, and so the whole thing mechanically reduced to scale. But not
a bit of it. Here is a Greek bas-relief of a chariot with two horses (upper figure, Plate XXI).
Your whole subject has therefore the depth of two horses side by side, say six or eight feet.
Your bas-relief has, on the scale,[131] say the depth of the third of an inch. Now, if you
gave only the sixth of an inch for the depth of the off horse, and, dividing him again, only
the twelfth of an inch for that of each foreleg, you would make him look a mile away from the
other, and his own forelegs a mile apart. Actually, the Greek has made the near leg of the
off horse project much beyond the off leg of the near horse; and has put nearly the whole depth
and power of his relief into the breast of the off horse, while for the whole distance from
the head of the nearest to the neck of the other, he has allowed himself only a shallow line;
knowing that, if he deepened that, he would give the nearest horse the look of having a thick
nose; whereas, by keeping that line down, he has not only made the head itself more delicate,
but detached it from the other by giving no cast shadow, and left the shadow below to serve
for thickness of breast, cutting it as sharp down as he possibly can, to make it bolder.

171. Here is a fine piece of business we have got into!--even supposing that all this selection
and adaptation were to be contrived under constant laws, and related only to the expression
of given forms. But the Greek sculptor, all this while, is not only debating and deciding how
to show what he wants, but, much more, debating and deciding what, as he can't show everything,
he will choose to show at all. Thus, being himself interested, and supposing that you will
be, in the manner of the driving, he takes great pains to carve the reins, to show you where
they are knotted, and how they are fastened round the driver's waist (you recollect how Hippolytus
was lost by doing that), but he does not care the least bit about the chariot, and having rather
more geometry than he likes in the cross and circle of one wheel of it, entirely omits the other!

172. I think you must see by this time that the sculptor's is not quite a trade which you can
teach like brickmaking; nor its produce an article of which you can supply any quantity "demanded"
for the next railroad waiting-room. It may perhaps, indeed, seem to you that, in the difficulties
thus presented by it, bas-relief involves more direct exertion of intellect than finished solid
sculpture. It is not so, however. The questions involved by bas-relief are of a more curious
and amusing kind, requiring great variety of expedients; though none except such as a true
workmanly instinct delights in inventing and invents easily; but design in solid sculpture
involves considerations of weight in mass, of balance, of perspective and opposition, in projecting
forms, and of restraint for those which must not project, such as none but the greatest masters
have ever completely solved; and they, not always; the difficulty of arranging the composition
so as to be agreeable from points of view on all sides of it, being, itself, arduous enough.

173. Thus far, I have been speaking only of the laws of structure relating to the projection
of the mass which becomes itself the sculpture. Another most interesting group of constructive
laws governs its relation to the line that contains or defines it.

In your Standard Series I have placed a photograph of the south transept of Rouen Cathedral.
Strictly speaking, all standards of Gothic are of the thirteenth century; but, in the fourteenth,
certain qualities of richness are obtained by the diminution of restraint; out of which we
must choose what is best in their kinds. The pedestals of the statues which once occupied the
lateral recesses are, as you see, covered with groups of figures, enclosed each in a quatrefoil
panel; the spaces between this panel and the enclosing square being filled with sculptures
of animals.

You cannot anywhere find a more lovely piece of fancy, or more illustrative of the quantity
of result that may be obtained with low and simple chiselling. The figures are all perfectly
simple in drapery, the story told by lines of action only in the main group, no accessories
being admitted. There is no undercutting anywhere, nor exhibition of technical skill, but the
fondest and tenderest appliance of it; and one of the principal charms of the whole is the
adaptation of every subject to its quaint limit. The tale must be told within the four petals
of the quatrefoil, and the wildest and playfullest beasts must never come out of their narrow
corners. The attention with which spaces of this kind are filled by the Gothic designers is
not merely a beautiful compliance with architectural requirements, but a definite assertion
of their delight in the restraint of law; for, in illuminating books, although, if they chose
it, they might have designed floral ornaments, as we now usually do, rambling loosely over
the leaves, and although, in later works, such license is often taken by them, in all books
of the fine time the wandering tendrils are enclosed by limits approximately rectilinear, and
in gracefullest branching often detach themselves from the right line only by curvature of
extreme severity.

174 Since the darkness and extent of shadow by which the sculpture is relieved necessarily
vary with the depth of the recess, there arise a series of problems, in deciding which the
wholesome desire for emphasis by means of shadow is too often exaggerated by the ambition of
the sculptor to show his skill in undercutting. The extreme of vulgarity is usually reached
when the entire bas-relief is cut hollow underneath, as in much Indian and Chinese work, so
as to relieve its forms against an absolute darkness; but no formal law can ever be given;
for exactly the same thing may be beautifully done for a wise purpose, by one person, which
is basely done, and to no purpose, or to a bad one, by another. Thus, the desire for emphasis
itself may be the craving of a deadened imagination, or the passion of a vigorous one; and
relief against shadow may be sought by one man only for sensation, and by another for intelligibility.
John of Pisa undercuts fiercely, in order to bring out the vigour of life which no level contour
could render; the Lombardi of Venice undercut delicately, in order to obtain beautiful lines,
and edges of faultless precision; but the base Indian craftsmen undercut only that people may
wonder how the chiselling was done through the holes, or that they may see every monster white
against black.

175. Yet, here again we are met by another necessity for discrimination. There may be a true
delight in the inlaying of white on dark, as there is a true delight in vigorous rounding.
Nevertheless, the general law is always, that, the lighter the incisions, and the broader the
surface, the grander, cæteris paribus, will be the work. Of the structural terms of that work
you now know enough to understand that the schools of good sculpture, considered in relation
to projection, divide themselves into four entirely distinct groups:--

     1st. Flat Relief, in which the surface is, in many places,
     absolutely flat; and the expression depends greatly on the
     lines of its outer contour, and on fine incisions within
     them.

     2nd. Round Relief, in which, as in the best coins, the
     sculptured mass projects so as to be capable of complete
     modulation into form, but is not anywhere undercut. The
     formation of a coin by the blow of a die necessitates, of
     course, the severest obedience to this law.

     3rd. Edged Relief. Undercutting admitted, so as to throw out
     the forms against a background of shadow.

     4th. Full Relief. The statue completely solid in form, and
     unreduced in retreating depth of it, yet connected locally
     with some definite part of the building, so as to be still
     dependent on the shadow of its background and direction of
     protective line.

176. Let me recommend you at once to take what pains may be needful to enable you to distinguish
these four kinds of sculpture, for the distinctions between them are not founded on mere differences
in gradation of depth. They are truly four species, or orders, of sculpture, separated from
each other by determined characters. I have used, you may have noted, hitherto in my Lectures,
the word "bas-relief" almost indiscriminately for all, because the degree of lowness or highness
of relief is not the question, but the method of relief. Observe again, therefore--

A. If a portion of the surface is absolutely flat, you have the first order--Flat Relief.

B. If every portion of the surface is rounded, but none undercut, you have Round Relief--essentially
that of seals and coins.

C. If any part of the edges be undercut, but the general projection of solid form reduced,
you have what I think you may conveniently call Foliate Relief,--the parts of the design overlapping
each other in places, like edges of leaves.

D. If the undercutting is bold and deep, and the projection of solid form unreduced, you have
full relief.

Learn these four names at once by heart:--

    Flat Relief.
    Round Relief.
    Foliate Relief.
    Full Relief.

And whenever you look at any piece of sculpture, determine first to which of these classes
it belongs; and then consider how the sculptor has treated it with reference to the necessary
structure--that reference, remember, being partly to the mechanical conditions of the material,
partly to the means of light and shade at his command.

177. To take a single instance. You know, for these many years, I have been telling our architects
with all the force of voice I had in me, that they could design nothing until they could carve
natural forms rightly. Many imagine that work was easy; but judge for yourselves whether it
be or not. In Plate XII., I have drawn, with approximate accuracy, a cluster of Phillyrea leaves
as they grow. Now, if we wanted to cut them in bas-relief, the first thing we should have to
consider would be the position of their outline on the marble;--here it is, as far down as
the spring of the leaves. But do you suppose that is what an ordinary sculptor could either
lay for his first sketch, or contemplate as a limit to be worked down to? Then consider how
the interlacing and springing of the leaves can be expressed within this outline. It must be
done by leaving such projection in the marble as will take the light in the same proportion
as the drawing does;--and a Florentine workman could do it, for close sight, without driving
one incision deeper, or raising a single surface higher, than the eighth of an inch. Indeed,
no sculptor of the finest time would design such a complex cluster of leaves as this, except
for bronze or iron work; they would take simpler contours for marble; but the laws of treatment
would, under these conditions, remain just as strict: and you may, perhaps, believe me now
when I tell you that, in any piece of fine structural sculpture by the great masters, there
is more subtlety and noble obedience to lovely laws than could be explained to you if I took
twenty lectures to do it in, instead of one.

178. There remains yet a point of mechanical treatment, on which I have not yet touched at
all; nor that the least important,--namely, the actual method and style of handling. A great
sculptor uses his tools exactly as a painter his pencil, and you may recognize the decision
of his thought, and glow of his temper, no less in the workmanship than the design. The modern
system of modelling the work in clay, getting it into form by machinery, and by the hands of
subordinates, and touching it at last, if indeed the (so called) sculptor touch it at all,
only to correct their inefficiencies, renders the production of good work in marble a physical
impossibility. The first result of it is that the sculptor thinks in clay instead of marble,
and loses his instinctive sense of the proper treatment of a brittle substance. The second
is that neither he nor the public recognize the touch of the chisel as expressive of personal
feeling or power, and that nothing is looked for except mechanical polish.

179. The perfectly simple piece of Greek relief represented in Plate XIII., will enable you
to understand at once,--examination of the original, at your leisure, will prevent you, I trust,
from ever forgetting--what is meant by the virtue of handling in sculpture.

The projection of the heads of the four horses, one behind the other, is certainly not more,
altogether, than three-quarters of an inch from the flat ground, and the one in front does
not in reality project more than the one behind it, yet, by mere drawing,[132] you see the
sculptor has got them to appear to recede in due order, and by the soft rounding of the flesh
surfaces, and modulation of the veins, he has taken away all look of flatness from the necks.
He has drawn the eyes and nostrils with dark incision, careful as the finest touches of a painter's
pencil: and then, at last, when he comes to the manes, he has let fly hand and chisel with
their full force, and where a base workman, (above all, if he had modelled the thing in clay
first,) would have lost himself in laborious imitation of hair, the Greek has struck the tresses
out with angular incisions, deep driven, every one in appointed place and deliberate curve,
yet flowing so free under his noble hand that you cannot alter, without harm, the bending of
any single ridge, nor contract, nor extend, a point of them. And if you will look back to Plate
IX. you will see the difference between this sharp incision, used to express horse-hair, and
the soft incision with intervening rounded ridge, used to express the hair of Apollo Chrysocomes;
and, beneath, the obliquely ridged incision used to express the plumes of his swan; in both
these cases the handling being much more slow, because the engraving is in metal; but the structural
importance of incision, as the means of effect, never lost sight of. Finally, here are two
actual examples of the work in marble of the two great schools of the world; one, a little
Fortune, standing tiptoe on the globe of the Earth, its surface traced with lines in hexagons;
not chaotic under Fortune's feet; Greek, this, and by a trained workman;--dug up in the temple
of Neptune at Corfu;--and here, a Florentine portrait-marble, found in the recent alterations,
face downwards, under the pavement of St'a Maria Novella;[133] both of them first-rate of their
kind; and both of them, while exquisitely finished at the telling points, showing, on all their
unregarded surfaces, the rough furrow of the fast-driven chisel, as distinctly as the edge
of a common paving-stone.

180. Let me suggest to you, in conclusion, one most interesting point of mental expression
in these necessary aspects of finely executed sculpture. I have already again and again pressed
on your attention the beginning of the arts of men in the make and use of the ploughshare.
Read more carefully--you might indeed do well to learn at once by heart,--the twenty-seven
lines of the Fourth Pythian, which describe the ploughing of Jason. There is nothing grander
extant in human fancy, nor set down in human words: but this great mythical expression of the
conquest of the earth-clay, and brute-force, by vital human energy, will become yet more interesting
to you when you reflect what enchantment has been cut, on whiter clay, by the tracing of finer
furrows;--what the delicate and consummate arts of man have done by the ploughing of marble,
and granite, and iron. You will learn daily more and more, as you advance in actual practice,
how the primary manual art of engraving, in the steadiness, clearness, and irrevocableness
of it, is the best art-discipline that can be given either to mind or hand;[134] you will recognize
one law of right, pronouncing itself in the well-resolved work of every age; you will see the
firmly traced and irrevocable incision determining not only the forms, but, in great part,
the moral temper, of all vitally progressive art; you will trace the same principle and power
in the furrows which the oblique sun shows on the granite of his own Egyptian city,--in the
white scratch of the stylus through the colour on a Greek vase--in the first delineation, on
the wet wall, of the groups of an Italian fresco; in the unerring and unalterable touch of
the great engraver of Nüremberg,--and in the deep driven and deep bitten ravines of metal by
which Turner closed, in embossed limits, the shadows of the Liber Studiorum.

Learn, therefore, in its full extent, the force of the great Greek word, [Greek: charassô];--and,
give me pardon--if you think pardon needed, that I ask you also to learn the full meaning of
the English word derived from it. Here, at the Ford of the Oxen of Jason, are other furrows
to be driven than these in the marble of Pentelicus. The fruitfullest, or the fatallest of
all ploughing is that by the thoughts of your youth, on the white field of its imagination.
For by these, either down to the disturbed spirit, "[Greek: kekoptai kai charassetai pedon];"
or around the quiet spirit, and on all the laws of conduct that hold it, as a fair vase its
frankincense, are ordained the pure colours, and engraved the just Characters, of Æonian life.

FOOTNOTES:

[126] Nothing is more wonderful, or more disgraceful among the forms of ignorance engendered
by modern vulgar occupations in pursuit of gain, than the unconsciousness, now total, that
fine art is essentially Athletic. I received a letter from Birmingham, some little time since,
inviting me to see how much, in glass manufacture, "machinery excelled rude hand work." The
writer had not the remotest conception that he might as well have asked me to come and see
a mechanical boat-race rowed by automata, and "how much machinery excelled rude arm-work."

Lecture, § 84.

[128] It is strange, at this day, to think of the relation of the Athenian Ceramicus to the
French Tile-fields, Tileries, or Tuileries; and how these last may yet become--have already
partly become--"the Potter's field," blood-bought (December, 1870.)

University galleries.

[130] The reference is to a cast from a small and low relief of Florentine work in the Kensington
Museum.

[131] The actual bas-relief is on a coin, and the projection not above the twentieth of an
inch, but I magnified it in photograph, for this Lecture, so as to represent a relief with
about the third of an inch for maximum projection.

[132] This plate has been executed from a drawing by Mr. Burgess, in which he has followed
the curves of incision with exquisite care, and preserved the effect of the surface of the
stone, where a photograph would have lost it by exaggerating accidental stains.

in my room at Corpus Christi College.

[134] That it was also, in, some cases, the earliest that the Greeks gave, is proved by Lucian's
account of his first lesson at his uncle's; the [Greek: enkopeus], literally "in-cutter"--being
the first tool put into his hand, and an earthenware tablet to cut upon, which the boy pressing
too hard, presently breaks;--gets beaten--goes home crying, and becomes, after his dream above
quoted, a philosopher instead of a sculptor.

LECTURE VI.

THE SCHOOL OF ATHENS.

December, 1870.

181. It can scarcely be needful for me to tell even the younger members of my present audience,
that the conditions necessary for the production of a perfect school of sculpture have only
twice been met in the history of the world, and then for a short time; nor for short time only,
but also in narrow districts, namely, in the valleys and islands of Ionian Greece, and in the
strip of land deposited by the Arno, between the Apennine crests and the sea.

All other schools, except these two, led severally by Athens in the fifth century before Christ,
and by Florence in the fifteenth of our own era, are imperfect; and the best of them are derivative:
these two are consummate in themselves, and the origin of what is best in others.

182. And observe, these Athenian and Florentine schools are both of equal rank, as essentially
original and independent. The Florentine, being subsequent to the Greek, borrowed much from
it; but it would have existed just as strongly--and, perhaps, in some respects, more nobly--had
it been the first, instead of the latter of the two. The task set to each of these mightiest
of the nations was, indeed, practically the same, and as hard to the one as to the other. The
Greeks found Phoenician and Etruscan art monstrous, and had to make them human. The Italians
found Byzantine and Norman art monstrous, and had to make them human. The original power in
the one case is easily traced; in the other it has partly to be unmasked, because the change
at Florence was, in many points, suggested and stimulated by the former school. But we mistake
in supposing that Athens taught Florence the laws of design; she taught her, in reality, only
the duty of truth.

183. You remember that I told you the highest art could do no more than rightly represent the
human form. This is the simple test, then, of a perfect school,--that it has represented the
human form, so that it is impossible to conceive of its being better done. And that, I repeat,
has been accomplished twice only: once in Athens, once in Florence. And so narrow is the excellence
even of these two exclusive schools, that it cannot be said of either of them that they represented
the entire human form. The Greeks perfectly drew, and perfectly moulded the body and limbs;
but there is, so far as I am aware, no instance of their representing the face as well as any
great Italian. On the other hand, the Italian painted and carved the face insuperably; but
I believe there is no instance of his having perfectly represented the body, which, by command
of his religion, it became his pride to despise, and his safety to mortify.

184. The general course of your study here renders it desirable that you should be accurately
acquainted with the leading principles of Greek sculpture; but I cannot lay these before you
without giving undue prominence to some of the special merits of that school, unless I previously
indicate the relation it holds to the more advanced, though less disciplined, excellence of
Christian art.

In this and the last lecture of the present course,[135] I shall endeavour, therefore, to mass
for you, in such rude and diagram-like outline as may be possible or intelligible, the main
characteristics of the two schools, completing and correcting the details of comparison afterwards;
and not answering, observe, at present, for any generalization I give you, except as a ground
for subsequent closer and more qualified statements.

And in carrying out this parallel, I shall speak indifferently of works of sculpture, and of
the modes of painting which propose to themselves the same objects as sculpture. And this indeed
Florentine, as opposed to Venetian, painting, and that of Athens in the fifth century, nearly
always did.

185. I begin, therefore, by comparing two designs of the simplest kind--engravings, or, at
least, linear drawings, both; one on clay, one on copper, made in the central periods of each
style, and representing the same goddess--Aphrodite. They are now set beside each other in
your Rudimentary Series. The first is from a patera lately found at Camirus, authoritatively
assigned by Mr. Newton, in his recent catalogue, to the best period of Greek art. The second
is from one of the series of engravings executed, probably, by Baccio Baldini, in 1485, out
of which I chose your first practical exercise--the Sceptre of Apollo. I cannot, however, make
the comparison accurate in all respects, for I am obliged to set the restricted type of the
Aphrodite Urania of the Greeks beside the universal Deity conceived by the Italian as governing
the air, earth, and sea; nevertheless the restriction in the mind of the Greek, and expatiation
in that of the Florentine, are both characteristic. The Greek Venus Urania is flying in heaven,
her power over the waters symbolized by her being borne by a swan, and her power over the earth
by a single flower in her right hand; but the Italian Aphrodite is rising out of the actual
sea, and only half risen: her limbs are still in the sea, her merely animal strength filling
the waters with their life; but her body to the loins is in the sunshine, her face raised to
the sky; her hand is about to lay a garland of flowers on the earth.

186. The Venus Urania of the Greeks, in her relation to men, has power only over lawful and
domestic love; therefore, she is fully dressed, and not only quite dressed, but most daintily
and trimly: her feet delicately sandalled, her gown spotted with little stars, her hair brushed
exquisitely smooth at the top of her head, trickling in minute waves down her forehead; and
though, because there's such a quantity of it, she can't possibly help having a chignon, look
how tightly she has fastened it in with her broad fillet. Of course she is married, so she
must wear a cap with pretty minute pendant jewels at the border; and a very small necklace,
all that her husband can properly afford, just enough to go closely round the neck, and no
more. On the contrary, the Aphrodite of the Italian, being universal love, is pure-naked; and
her long hair is thrown wild to the wind and sea.

These primal differences in the symbolism, observe, are only because the artists are thinking
of separate powers: they do not necessarily involve any national distinction in feeling. But
the differences I have next to indicate are essential, and characterize the two opposed national
modes of mind.

187. First, and chiefly. The Greek Aphrodite is a very pretty person, and the Italian a decidedly
plain one. That is because a Greek thought no one could possibly love any but pretty people;
but an Italian thought that love could give dignity to the meanest form that it inhabited,
and light to the poorest that it looked upon. So his Aphrodite will not condescend to be pretty.

188. Secondly. In the Greek Venus the breasts are broad and full, though perfectly severe in
their almost conical profile;--(you are allowed on purpose to see the outline of the right
breast, under the chiton:)--also the right arm is left bare, and you can just see the contour
of the front of the right limb and knee; both arm and limb pure and firm, but lovely. The plant
she holds in her hand is a branching and flowering one, the seed vessel prominent. These signs
all mean that her essential function is child-bearing.

On the contrary, in the Italian Venus the breasts are so small as to be scarcely traceable;
the body strong, and almost masculine in its angles; the arms meagre and unattractive, and
she lays a decorative garland of flowers on the earth. These signs mean that the Italian thought
of love as the strength of an eternal spirit, for ever helpful; and for ever crowned with flowers,
that neither know seed-time nor harvest, and bloom where there is neither death, nor birth.

189. Thirdly. The Greek Aphrodite is entirely calm, and looks straight forward. Not one feature
of her face is disturbed, or seems ever to have been subject to emotion. The Italian Aphrodite
looks up, her face all quivering and burning with passion and wasting anxiety. The Greek one
is quiet, self-possessed, and self-satisfied; the Italian incapable of rest, she has had no
thought nor care for herself; her hair has been bound by a fillet like the Greeks; but it is
now all fallen loose, and clotted with the sea, or clinging to her body; only the front tress
of it is caught by the breeze from her raised forehead, and lifted, in the place where the
tongues of fire rest on the brows, in the early Christian pictures of Pentecost, and the waving
fires abide upon the heads of Angelico's seraphim.

190. There are almost endless points of interest, great and small, to be noted in these differences
of treatment. This binding of the hair by the single fillet marks the straight course of one
great system of art method, from that Greek head which I showed you on the archaic coin of
the seventh century before Christ, to this of the fifteenth of our own era--nay, when you look
close, you will see the entire action of the head depends on one lock of hair falling back
from the ear, which it does in compliance with the old Greek observance of its being bent there
by the pressure of the helmet. That rippling of it down her shoulders comes from the Athena
of Corinth; the raising of it on her forehead, from the knot of the hair of Diana, changed
into the vestal fire of the angels.

The vast issues dependent on this change in the conception of the ruling passion of the human
soul, I will endeavour to show you, on a future occasion: in my present lecture, I shall limit
myself to the definition of the temper of Greek sculpture, and of its distinctions from Florentine
in the treatment of any subject whatever, be it love or hatred, hope or despair.

These great differences are mainly the following.

191. 1. A Greek never expresses momentary passion; a Florentine looks to momentary passion
as the ultimate object of his skill.

When you are next in London, look carefully in the British Museum at the casts from the statues
in the pediment of the Temple of Minerva at Ægina. You have there Greek work of definite date;--about
600 B.C., certainly before 580--of the purest kind; and you have the representation of a noble
ideal subject, the combats of the Æacidæ at Troy, with Athena herself looking on. But there
is no attempt whatever to represent expression in the features, none to give complexity of
action or gesture; there is no struggling, no anxiety, no visible temporary exertion of muscles.
There are fallen figures, one pulling a lance out of his wound, and others in attitudes of
attack and defence; several kneeling to draw their bows. But all inflict and suffer, conquer
or expire, with the same smile.

192. Plate XIV. gives you examples, from more advanced art, of true Greek representation; the
subjects being the two contests of leading import to the Greek heart--that of Apollo with the
Python, and of Hercules with the Nemean Lion. You see that in neither case is there the slightest
effort to represent the [Greek: lyssa] or agony of contest. No good Greek artist would have
you behold the suffering, either of gods, heroes, or men; nor allow you to be apprehensive
of the issue of their contest with evil beasts, or evil spirits. All such lower sources of
excitement are to be closed to you; your interest is to be in the thoughts involved by the
fact of the war; and in the beauty or rightness of form, whether active or inactive. I have
to work out this subject with you afterwards, and to compare with the pure Greek method of
thought, that of modern dramatic passion, engrafted on it, as typically in Turner's contest
of Apollo and the Python: in the meantime, be content with the statement of this first great
principle--that a Greek, as such, never expresses momentary passion.

193. Secondly. The Greek, as such, never expresses personal character, while a Florentine holds
it to be the ultimate condition of beauty. You are startled, I suppose, at my saying this,
having had it often pointed out to you, as a transcendent piece of subtlety in Greek art, that
you could distinguish Hercules from Apollo by his being stout, and Diana from Juno by her being
slender. That is very true; but those are general distinctions of class, not special distinctions
of personal character. Even as general, they are bodily, not mental. They are the distinctions,
in fleshly aspect, between an athlete and a musician,--between a matron and a huntress; but
in no wise distinguish the simple-hearted hero from the subtle Master of the Muses, nor the
wilful and fitful girl-goddess from the cruel and resolute matron-goddess. But judge for yourselves;--In
the successive plates, XV.--XVIII., I show you,[136] typically represented as the protectresses
of nations, the Argive, Cretan, and Lacinian Hera, the Messenian Demeter, the Athena of Corinth,
the Artemis of Syracuse, the fountain Arethusa of Syracuse, and the Sirem Ligeia of Terina.
Now, of these heads, it is true that some are more delicate in feature than the rest, and some
softer in expression: in other respects, can you trace any distinction between the Goddesses
of Earth and Heaven, or between the Goddess of Wisdom and the Water Nymph of Syracuse? So little
can you do so, that it would have remained a disputed question--had not the name luckily been
inscribed on some Syracusan coins--whether the head upon them was meant for Arethusa at all;
and, continually, it becomes a question respecting finished statues, if without attributes,
"Is this Bacchus or Apollo--Zeus or Poseidon?" There is a fact for you; noteworthy, I think!
There is no personal character in true Greek art:--abstract ideas of youth and age, strength
and swiftness, virtue and vice,--yes: but there is no individuality; and the negative holds
down to the revived conventionalism of the Greek school by Leonardo, when he tells you how
you are to paint young women, and how old ones; though a Greek would hardly have been so discourteous
to age as the Italian is in his canon of it,--"old women should be represented as passionate
and hasty, after the manner of Infernal Furies."

194. "But at least, if the Greeks do not give character, they give ideal beauty?" So it is
said, without contradiction. But will you look again at the series of coins of the best time
of Greek art, which I have just set before you? Are any of these goddesses or nymphs very beautiful?
Certainly the Junos are not. Certainly the Demeters are not. The Siren, and Arethusa, have
well-formed and regular features; but I am quite sure that if you look at them without prejudice,
you will think neither reach even the average standard of pretty English girls. The Venus Urania
suggests at first, the idea of a very charming person, but you will find there is no real depth
nor sweetness in the contours, looked at closely. And remember, these are chosen examples;
the best I can find of art current in Greece at the great time; and if even I were to take
the celebrated statues, of which only two or three are extant, not one of them excels the Venus
of Melos; and she, as I have already asserted, in The Queen of the Air, has nothing notable
in feature except dignity and simplicity. Of Athena I do not know one authentic type of great
beauty; but the intense ugliness which the Greeks could tolerate in their symbolism of her
will be convincingly proved to you by the coin represented in Plate VI. You need only look
at two or three vases of the best time, to assure yourselves that beauty of feature was, in
popular art, not only unattained, but unattempted; and finally,--and this you may accept as
a conclusive proof of the Greek insensitiveness to the most subtle beauty--there is little
evidence even in their literature, and none in their art, of their having ever perceived any
beauty in infancy, or early childhood.

195. The Greeks, then, do not give passion, do not give character, do not give refined or naïve
beauty. But you may think that the absence of these is intended to give dignity to the gods
and nymphs; and that their calm faces would be found, if you long observed them, instinct with
some expression of divine mystery or power.

I will convince you of the narrow range of Greek thought in these respects, by showing you,
from the two sides of one and the same coin, images of the most mysterious of their Deities,
and the most powerful,--Demeter and Zeus.

Remember, that just as the west coasts of Ireland and England catch first on their hills the
rain of the Atlantic, so the western Peloponnese arrests, in the clouds of the first mountain
ranges of Arcadia, the moisture of the Mediterranean; and over all the plains of Elis, Pylos,
and Messene, the strength and sustenance of men was naturally felt to be granted by Zeus; as,
on the east coast of Greece, the greater clearness of the air by the power of Athena. If you
will recollect the prayer of Rhea, in the single line of Callimachus--"[Greek: Gaia philê,
teke kai su teai d' ôdines elaphrai]," (compare Pausanias iv. 33, at the beginning,)--it will
mark for you the connection, in the Greek mind, of the birth of the mountain springs of Arcadia
with the birth of Zeus. And the centres of Greek thought on this western coast are necessarily
Elis, and, (after the time of Epaminondas,) Messene.

196. I show you the coin of Messene, because the splendid height and form of Mount Ithome were
more expressive of the physical power of Zeus than the lower hills of Olympia; and also because
it was struck just at the time of the most finished and delicate Greek art--a little after
the main strength of Phidias, but before decadence had generally pronounced itself. The coin
is a silver didrachm, bearing on one side a head of Demeter (Plate XVI., at the top); on the
other a full figure of Zeus Aietophoros (Plate XIX., at the top); the two together signifying
the sustaining strength of the earth and heaven. Look first at the head of Demeter. It is merely
meant to personify fulness of harvest; there is no mystery in it, no sadness, no vestige of
the expression which we should have looked for in any effort to realize the Greek thoughts
of the Earth Mother, as we find them spoken by the poets. But take it merely as personified
abundance;--the goddess of black furrow and tawny grass--how commonplace it is, and how poor!
The hair is grand, and there is one stalk of wheat set in it, which is enough to indicate the
goddess who is meant; but, in that very office, ignoble, for it shows that the artist could
only inform you that this was Demeter by such a symbol. How easy it would have been for a great
designer to have made the hair lovely with fruitful flowers, and the features noble in mystery
of gloom, or of tenderness. But here you have nothing to interest you, except the common Greek
perfections of a straight nose and a full chin.

197. We pass, on the reverse of the die, to the figure of Zeus Aietophoros. Think of the invocation
to Zeus in the Suppliants, (525), "King of Kings, and Happiest of the Happy, Perfectest of
the Perfect in strength, abounding in all things, Jove--hear us and be with us;" and then,
consider what strange phase of mind it was, which, under the very mountain-home of the god,
was content with this symbol of him as a well-fed athlete, holding a diminutive and crouching
eagle on his fist. The features and the right hand have been injured in this coin, but the
action of the arms shows that it held a thunderbolt, of which, I believe, the twisted rays
were triple. In the, presumably earlier, coin engraved by Millingen, however,[137] it is singly
pointed only; and the added inscription "[Greek: ITHÔM]," in the field, renders the conjecture
of Millingen probable, that this is a rude representation of the statue of Zeus Ithomates,
made by Ageladas, the master of Phidias; and I think it has, indeed, the aspect of the endeavour,
by a workman of more advanced knowledge, and more vulgar temper, to put the softer anatomy
of later schools into the simple action of an archaic figure. Be that as it may, here is one
of the most refined cities of Greece content with the figure of an athlete as the representative
of their own mountain god; marked as a divine power merely by the attributes of the eagle and
thunderbolt.

198. Lastly. The Greeks have not, it appears, in any supreme way, given to their statues character,
beauty, or divine strength. Can they give divine sadness? Shall we find in their artwork any
of that pensiveness and yearning for the dead, which fills the chants of their tragedy? I suppose
if anything like nearness or firmness of faith in afterlife is to be found in Greek legend,
you might look for it in the stories about the Island of Leuce, at the mouth of the Danube,
inhabited by the ghosts of Achilles, Patroclus, Ajax the son of Oïleus, and Helen; and in which
the pavement of the Temple of Achilles was washed daily by the sea-birds with their wings,
dipping them in the sea.

Now it happens that we have actually on a coin of the Locrians the representation of the ghost
of the Lesser Ajax. There is nothing in the history of human imagination more lovely, than
their leaving always a place for his spirit, vacant in their ranks of battle. But here is their
sculptural representation of the phantom; (lower figure, Plate XIX.), and I think you will
at once agree with me in feeling that it would be impossible to conceive anything more completely
unspiritual. You might more than doubt that it could have been meant for the departed soul,
unless you were aware of the meaning of this little circlet between the feet. On other coins
you find his name inscribed there, but in this you have his habitation, the haunted Island
of Leuce itself, with the waves flowing round it.

199. Again and again, however, I have to remind you, with respect to these apparently frank
and simple failures, that the Greek always intends you to think for yourself, and understand,
more than he can speak. Take this instance at our hands, the trim little circlet for the Island
of Leuce. The workman knows very well it is not like the island, and that he could not make
it so; that at its best, his sculpture can be little more than a letter; and yet, in putting
this circlet, and its encompassing fretwork of minute waves, he does more than if he had merely
given you a letter L, or written "Leuce." If you know anything of beaches and sea, this symbol
will set your imagination at work in recalling them; then you will think of the temple service
of the novitiate sea-birds, and of the ghosts of Achilles and Patroclus appearing, like the
Dioscuri, above the storm-clouds of the Euxine. And the artist, throughout his work, never
for an instant loses faith in your sympathy and passion being ready to answer his;--if you
have none to give, he does not care to take you into his counsel; on the whole, would rather
that you should not look at his work.

200. But if you have this sympathy to give, you may be sure that whatever he does for you will
be right, as far as he can render it so. It may not be sublime, nor beautiful, nor amusing;
but it will be full of meaning, and faithful in guidance. He will give you clue to myriads
of things that he cannot literally teach; and, so far as he does teach, you may trust him.
Is not this saying much?

And as he strove only to teach what was true, so, in his sculptured symbol, he strove only
to carve what was--Right. He rules over the arts to this day, and will for ever, because he
sought not first for beauty, nor first for passion, or for invention, but for Rightness; striving
to display, neither himself nor his art, but the thing that he dealt with, in its simplicity.
That is his specific character as a Greek. Of course, every nation's character is connected
with that of others surrounding or preceding it; and in the best Greek work you will find some
things that are still false, or fanciful; but whatever in it is false or fanciful, is not the
Greek part of it--it is the Phoenician, or Egyptian, or Pelasgian part. The essential Hellenic
stamp is veracity:--Eastern nations drew their heroes with eight legs, but the Greeks drew
them with two;--Egyptians drew their deities with cats' heads, but the Greeks drew them with
men's; and out of all fallacy, disproportion, and indefiniteness, they were, day by day, resolvedly
withdrawing and exalting themselves into restricted and demonstrable truth.

201. And now, having cut away the misconceptions which encumbered our thoughts, I shall be
able to put the Greek school into some clearness of its position for you, with respect to the
art of the world. That relation is strangely duplicate; for on one side, Greek art is the root
of all simplicity; and on the other, of all complexity.

On one side I say, it is the root of all simplicity. If you were for some prolonged period
to study Greek sculpture exclusively in the Elgin Room of the British Museum, and were then
suddenly transported to the Hôtel de Cluny, or any other museum of Gothic and barbarian workmanship,
you would imagine the Greeks were the masters of all that was grand, simple, wise, and tenderly
human, opposed to the pettiness of the toys of the rest of mankind.

202. On one side of their work they are so. From all vain and mean decoration--all weak and
monstrous error, the Greeks rescue the forms of man and beast, and sculpture them in the nakedness
of their true flesh, and with the fire of their living soul. Distinctively from other races,
as I have now, perhaps to your weariness, told you, this is the work of the Greek, to give
health to what was diseased, and chastisement to what was untrue. So far as this is found in
any other school, hereafter, it belongs to them by inheritance from the Greeks, or invests
them with the brotherhood of the Greek. And this is the deep meaning of the myth of Dædalus
as the giver of motion to statues. The literal change from the binding together of the feet
to their separation, and the other modifications of action which took place, either in progressive
skill, or often, as the mere consequence of the transition from wood to stone, (a figure carved
out of one wooden log must have necessarily its feet near each other, and hands at its sides),
these literal changes are as nothing, in the Greek fable, compared to the bestowing of apparent
life. The figures of monstrous gods on Indian temples have their legs separate enough; but
they are infinitely more dead than the rude figures at Branchidæ sitting with their hands on
their knees. And, briefly, the work of Dædalus is the giving of deceptive life, as that of
Prometheus the giving of real life; and I can put the relation of Greek to all other art, in
this function, before you in easily compared and remembered examples.

203. Here, on the right, in Plate XX., is an Indian bull, colossal, and elaborately carved,
which you may take as a sufficient type of the bad art of all the earth. False in form, dead
in heart, and loaded with wealth, externally. We will not ask the date of this; it may rest
in the eternal obscurity of evil art, everywhere and for ever. Now, besides this colossal bull,
here is a bit of Dædalus work, enlarged from a coin not bigger than a shilling: look at the
two together, and you ought to know, henceforward, what Greek art means, to the end of your days.

204. In this aspect of it then, I say, it is the simplest and nakedest of lovely veracities.
But it has another aspect, or rather another pole, for the opposition is diametric. As the
simplest, so also it is the most complex of human art. I told you in my fifth Lecture, showing
you the spotty picture of Velasquez, that an essential Greek character is a liking for things
that are dappled. And you cannot but have noticed how often and how prevalently the idea which
gave its name to the Porch of Polygnotus, "[Greek: stoa poikilê]," occurs to the Greeks as
connected with the finest art. Thus, when the luxurious city is opposed to the simple and healthful
one, in the second book of Plato's Polity, you find that, next to perfumes, pretty ladies,
and dice, you must have in it "[Greek: poikilia]," which observe, both in that place and again
in the third book, is the separate art of joiners' work, or inlaying; but the idea of exquisitely
divided variegation or division, both in sight and sound--the "ravishing division to the lute,"
as in Pindar's "[Greek: poikiloi hymnoi]"--runs through the compass of all Greek art-description;
and if, instead of studying that art among marbles you were to look at it only on vases of
a fine time, (look back, for instance, to Plate IV. here), your impression of it would be,
instead of breadth and simplicity, one of universal spottiness and chequeredness, "[Greek:
en angeôn Herkesin pampoikilois];" and of the artist's delighting in nothing so much as in
crossed or starred or spotted things; which, in right places, he and his public both do unlimitedly.
Indeed they hold it complimentary even to a trout, to call him a "spotty." Do you recollect
the trout in the tributaries of the Ladon, which Pausanias says were spotted, so that they
were like thrushes and which, the Arcadians told him, could speak? In this last [Greek: poikilia],
however, they disappointed him. "I, indeed, saw some of them caught," he says, "but I did not
hear any of them speak, though I waited beside the river till sunset."

205. I must sum roughly now, for I have detained you too long.

The Greeks have been thus the origin not only of all broad, mighty, and calm conception, but
of all that is divided, delicate, and tremulous; "variable as the shade, by the light quivering
aspen made." To them, as first leaders of ornamental design, belongs, of right, the praise
of glistenings in gold, piercings in ivory, stainings in purple, burnishings in dark blue steel;
of the fantasy of the Arabian roof--quartering of the Christian shield,--rubric and arabesque
of Christian scripture; in fine, all enlargement, and all diminution of adorning thought, from
the temple to the toy, and from the mountainous pillars of Agrigentum to the last fineness
of fretwork in the Pisan Chapel of the Thorn.

And in their doing all this, they stand as masters of human order and justice, subduing the
animal nature guided by the spiritual one, as you see the Sicilian Charioteer stands, holding
his horse-reins, with the wild lion racing beneath him, and the flying angel above, on the
beautiful coin of early Syracuse; (lowest in Plate XXI).

And the beginnings of Christian chivalary were in that Greek bridling of the dark and the white
horses.

206. Not that a Greek never made mistakes. He made as many as we do ourselves, nearly;--he
died of his mistakes at last--as we shall die of them; but so far he was separated from the
herd of more mistaken and more wretched nations--so far as he was Greek--it was by his rightness.
He lived, and worked, and was satisfied with the fatness of his land, and the fame of his deeds,
by his justice, and reason, and modesty. He became Græculus esuriens, little, and hungry, and
every man's errand-boy, by his iniquity, and his competition, and his love of talk. But his
Græcism was in having done, at least at one period of his dominion, more than anybody else,
what was modest, useful, and eternally true; and as a workman, he verily did, or first suggested
the doing of, everything possible to man.

Take Dædalus, his great type of the practically executive craftsman, and the inventor of expedients
in craftsmanship, (as distinguished from Prometheus, the institutor of moral order in art).
Dædalus invents,--he, or his nephew,--

The potter's wheel, and all work in clay;

The saw, and all work in wood;

The masts and sails of ships, and all modes of motion; (wings only proving too dangerous!)

The entire art of minute ornament;

And the deceptive life of statues.

By his personal toil, he involves the fatal labyrinth for Minos; builds an impregnable fortress
for the Agrigentines; adorns healing baths among the wild parsley fields of Selinus; buttresses
the precipices of Eryx, under the temple of Aphrodite; and for her temple itself--finishes
in exquisiteness the golden honeycomb.

207. Take note of that last piece of his art: it is connected with many things which I must
bring before you when we enter on the study of architecture. That study we shall begin at the
foot of the Baptistery of Florence, which, of all buildings known to me, unites the most perfect
symmetry with the quaintest [Greek: poikilia]. Then, from the tomb of your own Edward the Confessor,
to the farthest shrine of the opposite Arabian and Indian world, I must show you how the glittering
and iridescent dominion of Dædalus prevails; and his ingenuity in division, interposition,
and labyrinthine sequence, more widely still. Only this last summer I found the dark red masses
of the rough sandstone of Furness Abbey had been fitted by him, with no less pleasure than
he had in carving them, into wedged hexagons--reminiscences of the honeycomb of Venus Erycina.
His ingenuity plays around the framework of all the noblest things; and yet the brightness
of it has a lurid shadow. The spot of the fawn, of the bird, and the moth, may be harmless.
But Dædalus reigns no less over the spot of the leopard and snake. That cruel and venomous
power of his art is marked, in the legends of him, by his invention of the saw from the serpent's
tooth; and his seeking refuge, under blood-guiltiness, with Minos, who can judge evil, and
measure, or remit, the penalty of it, but not reward good: Rhadamanthus only can measure that;
but Minos is essentially the recognizer of evil deeds "conoscitor delle peccata," whom, therefore,
you find in Dante under the form of the [Greek: erpeton]. "Cignesi con la coda tante volte,
quantunque gradi vuol che giu sia messa."

And this peril of the influence of Dædalus is twofold; first in leading us to delight in glitterings
and semblances of things, more than in their form, or truth;--admire the harlequin's jacket
more than the hero's strength; and love the gilding of the missal more than its words;--but
farther, and worse, the ingenuity of Dædalus may even become bestial, an instinct for mechanical
labour only, strangely involved with a feverish and ghastly cruelty:--(you will find this distinct
in the intensely Dædal work of the Japanese); rebellious, finally, against the laws of nature
and honour, and building labyrinths for monsters,--not combs for bees.

208. Gentlemen, we of the rough northern race may never, perhaps, be able to learn from the
Greek his reverence for beauty: but we may at least learn his disdain of mechanism:--of all
work which he felt to be monstrous and inhuman in its imprudent dexterities.

We hold ourselves, we English, to be good workmen. I do not think I speak with light reference
to recent calamity, (for I myself lost a young relation, full of hope and good purpose, in
the foundered ship London,) when I say that either an Æginetan or Ionian shipwright built ships
that could be fought from, though they were under water; and neither of them would have been
proud of having built one that would fill and sink helplessly if the sea washed over her deck,
or turn upside down if a squall struck her topsail.

Believe me, gentlemen, good workmanship consists in continence and common sense, more than
in frantic expatiation of mechanical ingenuity; and if you would be continent and rational,
you had better learn more of Art than you do now, and less of Engineering. What is taking place
at this very hour,[138] among the streets, once so bright, and avenues once so pleasant, of
the fairest city in Europe, may surely lead us all to feel that the skill of Dædalus, set to
build impregnable fortresses, is not so wisely applied as in framing the [Greek: trêton ponou]--the
golden honeycomb.

[135] The closing Lecture, on the religious temper of the Florentine, though necessary for
the complete explanation of the subject to my class, at the time, introduced new points of
inquiry which I do not choose to lay before the general reader until they can be examined in
fuller sequence. The present volume, therefore, closes with the Sixth Lecture, and that on
Christian art will be given as the first of the published course on Florentine Sculpture.

THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND.

(Delivered at the R. A. Institution, Woolwich, December 14, 1869.)

I would fain have left to the frank expression of the moment, but fear I could not have found
clear words--I cannot easily find them, even deliberately,--to tell you how glad I am, and
yet how ashamed, to accept your permission to speak to you. Ashamed of appearing to think that
I can tell you any truth which you have not more deeply felt than I; but glad in the thought
that my less experience, and way of life sheltered from the trials, and free from the responsibilities
of yours, may have left me with something of a child's power of help to you; a sureness of
hope, which may perhaps be the one thing that can be helpful to men who have done too much
not to have often failed in doing all that they desired. And indeed, even the most hopeful
of us, cannot but now be in many things apprehensive. For this at least we all know too well,
that we are on the eve of a great political crisis, if not of political change. That a struggle
is approaching between the newly-risen power of democracy and the apparently departing power
of feudalism; and another struggle, no less imminent, and far more dangerous, between wealth
and pauperism. These two quarrels are constantly thought of as the same. They are being fought
together, and an apparently common interest unites for the most part the millionaire with the
noble, in resistance to a multitude, crying, part of it for bread and part of it for liberty.

And yet no two quarrels can be more distinct. Riches--so far from being necessary to noblesse--are
adverse to it. So utterly adverse, that the first character of all the Nobilities which have
founded great dynasties in the world is to be poor;--often poor by oath--always poor by generosity.
And of every true knight in the chivalric ages, the first thing history tells you is, that
he never kept treasure for himself.

Thus the causes of wealth and noblesse are not the same; but opposite. On the other hand, the
causes of anarchy and of the poor are not the same, but opposite. Side by side, in the same
rank, are now indeed set the pride that revolts against authority, and the misery that appeals
against avarice. But, so far from being a common cause, all anarchy is the forerunner of poverty,
and all prosperity begins in obedience. So that thus, it has become impossible to give due
support to the cause of order, without seeming to countenance injury; and impossible to plead
justly the claims of sorrow, without seeming to plead also for those of license.

Let me try, then, to put in very brief terms, the real plan of this various quarrel, and the
truth of the cause on each side. Let us face that full truth, whatever it may be, and decide
what part, according to our power, we should take in the quarrel.

First. For eleven hundred years, all but five, since Charlemagne set on his head the Lombard
crown, the body of European people have submitted patiently to be governed; generally by kings--always
by single leaders of some kind. But for the last fifty years they have begun to suspect, and
of late they have many of them concluded, that they have been on the whole ill-governed, or
misgoverned, by their kings. Whereupon they say, more and more widely, "Let us henceforth have
no kings; and no government at all."

Now we said, we must face the full truth of the matter, in order to see what we are to do.
And the truth is that the people have been misgoverned;--that very little is to be said, hitherto,
for most of their masters--and that certainly in many places they will try their new system
of "no masters:"--and as that arrangement will be delightful to all foolish persons, and, at
first, profitable to all wicked ones,--and as these classes are not wanting or unimportant
in any human society,--the experiment is likely to be tried extensively. And the world may
be quite content to endure much suffering with this fresh hope, and retain its faith in anarchy,
whatever comes of it, till it can endure no more.

Then, secondly. The people have begun to suspect that one particular form of this past misgovernment
has been, that their masters have set them to do all the work, and have themselves taken all
the wages. In a word, that what was called governing them, meant only wearing fine clothes,
and living on good fare at their expense. And I am sorry to say, the people are quite right
in this opinion also. If you inquire into the vital fact of the matter, this you will find
to be the constant structure of European society for the thousand years of the feudal system;
it was divided into peasants who lived by working; priests who lived by begging; and knights
who lived by pillaging; and as the luminous public mind becomes gradually cognizant of these
facts, it will assuredly not suffer things to be altogether arranged that way any more; and
the devising of other ways will be an agitating business; especially because the first impression
of the intelligent populace is, that whereas, in the dark ages, half the nation lived idle,
in the bright ages to come, the whole of it may.

Now, thirdly--and here is much the worst phase of the crisis. This past system of misgovernment,
especially during the last three hundred years, has prepared, by its neglect, a class among
the lower orders which it is now peculiarly difficult to govern. It deservedly lost their respect--but
that was the least part of the mischief. The deadly part of it was, that the lower orders lost
their habit, and at last their faculty, of respect;--lost the very capability of reverence,
which is the most precious part of the human soul. Exactly in the degree in which you can find
creatures greater than yourself, to look up to, in that degree, you are ennobled yourself,
and, in that degree, happy. If you could live always in the presence of archangels, you would
be happier than in that of men; but even if only in the company of admirable knights and beautiful
ladies, the more noble and bright they were, and the more you could reverence their virtue
the happier you would be. On the contrary, if you were condemned to live among a multitude
of idiots, dumb, distorted and malicious, you would not be happy in the constant sense of your
own superiority. Thus all real joy and power of progress in humanity depend on finding something
to reverence; and all the baseness and misery of humanity begin in a habit of disdain. Now,
by general misgovernment, I repeat, we have created in Europe a vast populace, and out of Europe
a still vaster one, which has lost even the power and conception of reverence;[139]--which
exists only in the worship of itself--which can neither see anything beautiful around it, nor
conceive anything virtuous above it; which has, towards all goodness and greatness, no other
feelings than those of the lowest creatures--fear, hatred, or hunger a populace which has sunk
below your appeal in their nature, as it has risen beyond your power in their multitude;--whom
you can now no more charm than you can the adder, nor discipline, than you can the summer fly.

It is a crisis, gentlemen; and time to think of it. I have roughly and broadly put it before
you in its darkness. Let us look what we may find of light.

Only the other day, in a journal which is a fairly representative exponent of the Conservatism
of our day, and for the most part not at all in favor of strikes or other popular proceedings;
only about three weeks since, there was a leader, with this, or a similar, title--"What is
to become of the House of Lords?" It startled me, for it seemed as if we were going even faster
than I had thought, when such a question was put as a subject of quite open debate, in a journal
meant chiefly for the reading of the middle and upper classes. Open or not--the debate is near.
What is to become of them? And the answer to such question depends first on their being able
to answer another question--"What is the use of them!" For some time back, I think the theory
of the nation has been, that they are useful as impediments to business, so as to give time
for second thoughts. But the nation is getting impatient of impediments to business; and certainly,
sooner or later, will think it needless to maintain these expensive obstacles to its humors.
And I have not heard, either in public, or from any of themselves, a clear expression of their
own conception of their use. So that it seems thus to become needful for all men to tell them,
as our one quite clear-sighted teacher, Carlyle, has been telling us for many a year, that
the use of the Lords of a country is to govern the country. If they answer that use, the country
will rejoice in keeping them; if not, that will become of them which must of all things found
to have lost their serviceableness.

Here, therefore, is the one question, at this crisis, for them, and for us. Will they be lords
indeed, and give us laws--dukes indeed, and give us guiding--princes indeed, and give us beginning,
of truer dynasty, which shall not be soiled by covetousness, nor disordered by iniquity? Have
they themselves sunk so far as not to hope this? Are there yet any among them who can stand
forward with open English brows, and say,--So far as in me lies, I will govern with my might,
not for Dieu et mon Droit, but for the first grand reading of the war cry, from which that
was corrupted, "Dieu et Droit?" Among them I know there are some--among you, soldiers of England,
I know there are many, who can do this; and in you is our trust. I, one of the lower people
of your country, ask of you in their name--you whom I will not any more call soldiers, but
by the truer name of Knights;--Equites of England. How many yet of you are there, knights errant
now beyond all former fields of danger--knights patient now beyond all former endurance; who
still retain the ancient and eternal purpose of knighthood, to subdue the wicked, and aid the
weak? To them, be they few or many, we English people call for help to the wretchedness, and
for rule over the baseness, of multitudes desolate and deceived, shrieking to one another this
new gospel of their new religion. "Let the weak do as they can, and the wicked as they will."

I can hear you saying in your hearts, even the bravest of you, "The time is past for all that."
Gentlemen, it is not so. The time has come for more than all that. Hitherto, soldiers have
given their lives for false fame, and for cruel power. The day is now when they must give their
lives for true fame, and for beneficent power: and the work is near every one of you--close
beside you--the means of it even thrust into your hands. The people are crying to you for command,
and you stand there at pause, and silent. You think they don't want to be commanded; try them;
determine what is needful for them--honorable for them; show it them, promise to bring them
to it, and they will follow you through fire. "Govern us," they cry with one heart, though
many minds. They can be governed still, these English; they are men still; not gnats, nor serpents.
They love their old ways yet, and their old masters, and their old land. They would fain live
in it, as many as may stay there, if you will show them how, there, to live;--or show them
even, how, there, like Englishmen, to die.

"To live in it, as many as may!" How many do you think may? How many can? How many do you want
to live there? As masters, your first object must be to increase your power; and in what does
the power of a country consist? Will you have dominion over its stones, or over its clouds,
or over its souls? What do you mean by a great nation, but a great multitude of men who are
true to each other, and strong, and of worth? Now you can increase the multitude only definitely--your
island has only so much standing room--but you can increase the worth indefinitely. It is but
a little island;--suppose, little as it is, you were to fill it with friends? You may, and
that easily. You must, and that speedily; or there will be an end to this England of ours,
and to all its loves and enmities.

To fill this little island with true friends--men brave, wise, and happy! Is it so impossible,
think you, after the world's eighteen hundred years of Christianity, and our own thousand years
of toil, to fill only this little white gleaming crag with happy creatures, helpful to each
other? Africa, and India, and the Brazilian wide-watered plain, are these not wide enough for
the ignorance of our race? have they not space enough for its pain? Must we remain here also
savage,--here at enmity with each other,--here foodless, houseless, in rags, in dust, and without
hope, as thousands and tens of thousands of us are lying? Do not think it, gentlemen. The thought
that it is inevitable is the last infidelity; infidelity not to God only, but to every creature
and every law that He has made. Are we to think that the earth was only shaped to be a globe
of torture; and that there cannot be one spot of it where peace can rest, or justice reign?
Where are men ever to be happy, if not in England? by whom shall they ever be taught to do
right, if not by you? Are we not of a race first among the strong ones of the earth; the blood
in us incapable of weariness, unconquerable by grief? Have we not a history of which we can
hardly think without becoming insolent in our just pride of it? Can we dare, without passing
every limit of courtesy to other nations, to say how much more we have to be proud of in our
ancestors than they? Among our ancient monarchs, great crimes stand out as monstrous and strange.
But their valor, and, according to their understanding, their benevolence, are constant. The
Wars of the Roses, which are as a fearful crimson shadow on our land, represent the normal
condition of other nations; while from the days of the Heptarchy downwards we have had examples
given us, in all ranks, of the most varied and exalted virtue; a heap of treasure that no moth
can corrupt, and which even our traitorship, if we are to become traitors to it, cannot sully.

And this is the race, then, that we know not any more how to govern! and this the history which
we are to behold broken off by sedition! and this is the country, of all others, where life
is to become difficult to the honest, and ridiculous to the wise! And the catastrophe, forsooth,
is to come just when we have been making swiftest progress beyond the wisdom and wealth of
the past. Our cities are a wilderness of spinning wheels instead of palaces; yet the people
have not clothes. We have blackened every leaf of English greenwood with ashes, and the people
die of cold; our harbors are a forest of merchant ships, and the people die of hunger.

Whose fault is it? Yours, gentlemen; yours only. You alone can feed them, and clothe, and bring
into their right minds, for you only can govern--that is to say, you only can educate them.

Educate, or govern, they are one and the same word. Education does not mean teaching people
to know what they do not know. It means teaching them to behave as they do not behave. And
the true "compulsory education" which the people now ask of you is not catechism, but drill.
It is not teaching the youth of England the shapes of letters and the tricks of numbers; and
then leaving them to turn their arithmetic to roguery, and their literature to lust. It is,
on the contrary, training them into the perfect exercise and kingly continence of their bodies
and souls. It is a painful, continual, and difficult work; to be done by kindness, by watching,
by warning, by precept, and by praise,--but above all--by example.

Compulsory! Yes, by all means! "Go ye out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to
come in." Compulsory! Yes, and gratis also. Dei Gratia, they must be taught, as, Dei Gratia,
you are set to teach them. I hear strange talk continually, "how difficult it is to make people
pay for being educated!" Why, I should think so! Do you make your children pay for their education,
or do you give it them compulsorily, and gratis? You do not expect them to pay you for their
teaching, except by becoming good children. Why should you expect a peasant to pay for his,
except by becoming a good man?--payment enough, I think, if we knew it. Payment enough to himself,
as to us. For that is another of our grand popular mistakes--people are always thinking of
education as a means of livelihood. Education is not a profitable business, but a costly one;
nay, even the best attainments of it are always unprofitable, in any terms of coin. No nation
ever made its bread either by its great arts, or its great wisdoms. By its minor arts or manufactures,
by its practical knowledges, yes: but its noble scholarship, its noble philosophy, and its
noble art, are always to be bought as a treasure, not sold for a livelihood. You do not learn
that you may live--you live that you may learn. You are to spend on National Education, and
to be spent for it, and to make by it, not more money, but better men;--to get into this British
Island the greatest possible number of good and brave Englishmen. They are to be your "money's
worth."

But where is the money to come from? Yes, that is to be asked. Let us, as quite the first business
in this our national crisis, look not only into our affairs, but into our accounts, and obtain
some general notion how we annually spend our money, and what we are getting for it. Observe,
I do not mean to inquire into the public revenue only; of that some account is rendered already.
But let us do the best we can to set down the items of the national private expenditure; and
know what we spend altogether, and how.

To begin with this matter of education. You probably have nearly all seen the admirable lecture
lately given by Captain Maxse, at Southampton. It contains a clear statement of the facts at
present ascertained as to our expenditure in that respect. It appears that of our public moneys,
for every pound that we spend on education we spend twelve either in charity or punishment;--ten
millions a year in pauperism and crime, and eight hundred thousand in instruction. Now Captain
Maxse adds to this estimate of ten millions public money spent on crime and want, a more or
less conjectural sum of eight millions for private charities. My impression is that this is
much beneath the truth, but at all events it leaves out of consideration much the heaviest
and saddest form of charity--the maintenance, by the working members of families, of the unfortunate
or ill-conducted persons whom the general course of misrule now leaves helpless to be the burden
of the rest.

Now I want to get first at some, I do not say approximate, but at all events some suggestive,
estimate of the quantity of real distress and misguided life in this country. Then next, I
want some fairly representative estimate of our private expenditure in luxuries. We won't spend
more, publicly, it appears, than eight hundred thousand a year, on educating men gratis. I
want to know, as nearly as possible, what we spend privately a year, in educating horses gratis.
Let us, at least, quit ourselves in this from the taunt of Rabshakeh, and see that for every
horse we train also a horseman; and that the rider be at least as high-bred as the horse, not
jockey, but chevalier. Again, we spend eight hundred thousand, which is certainly a great deal
of money, in making rough minds bright. I want to know how much we spend annually in making
rough stones bright; that is to say, what may be the united annual sum, or near it, of our
jewellers' bills. So much we pay for educating children gratis;--how much for educating diamonds
gratis? and which pays best for brightening, the spirit or the charcoal? Let us get those two
items set down with some sincerity, and a few more of the same kind. Publicly set down. We
must not be ashamed of the way we spend our money. If our right hand is not to know what our
left does, it must not be because it would be ashamed if it did.

That is, therefore, quite the first practical thing to be done. Let every man who wishes well
to his country, render it yearly an account of his income, and of the main heads of his expenditure;
or, if he is ashamed to do so, let him no more impute to the poor their poverty as a crime,
nor set them to break stones in order to frighten them from committing it. To lose money ill
is indeed often a crime; but to get it ill is a worse one, and to spend it ill, worst of all.
You object, Lords of England, to increase, to the poor, the wages you give them, because they
spend them, you say, unadvisedly. Render them, therefore, an account of the wages which they
give you; and show them, by your example, how to spend theirs, to the last farthing advisedly.

It is indeed time to make this an acknowledged subject of instruction, to the workingman,--how
to spend his wages. For, gentlemen, we must give that instruction, whether we will or no, one
way or the other. We have given it in years gone by; and now we find fault with our peasantry
for having been too docile, and profited too shrewdly by our tuition. Only a few days since
I had a letter from the wife of a village rector, a man of common sense and kindness, who was
greatly troubled in his mind because it was precisely the men who got highest wages in summer
that came destitute to his door in the winter. Destitute, and of riotous temper--for their
method of spending wages in their period of prosperity was by sitting two days a week in the
tavern parlor, ladling port wine, not out of bowls, but out of buckets. Well, gentlemen, who
taught them that method of festivity? Thirty years ago, I, a most inexperienced freshman, went
to my first college supper; at the head of the table sat a nobleman of high promise and of
admirable powers, since dead of palsy; there also we had in the midst of us, not buckets, indeed,
but bowls as large as buckets; there also, we helped ourselves with ladles. There (for this
beginning of college education was compulsory), I choosing ladlefuls of punch instead of claret,
because I was then able, unperceived to pour them into my waistcoat instead of down my throat,
stood it out to the end, and helped to carry four of my fellow-students, one of them the son
of the head of a college, head foremost, down stairs and home.

Such things are no more; but the fruit of them remains, and will for many a day to come. The
laborers whom you cannot now shut out of the ale-house are only the too faithful disciples
of the gentlemen who were wont to shut themselves into the dining-room. The gentlemen have
not thought it necessary, in order to correct their own habits, to diminish their incomes;
and, believe me, the way to deal with your drunken workman is not to lower his wages,--but
to mend his wits.[140]

And if indeed we do not yet see quite clearly how to deal with the sins of our poor brother,
it is possible that our dimness of sight may still have other causes that can be cast out.
There are two opposite cries of the great liberal and conservative parties, which are both
most right, and worthy to be rallying cries. On their side "let every man have his chance;"
on yours "let every man stand in his place." Yes, indeed, let that be so, every man in his
place, and every man fit for it. See that he holds that place from Heaven's Providence; and
not from his family's Providence. Let the Lords Spiritual quit themselves of simony, we laymen
will look after the heretics for them. Let the Lords Temporal quit themselves of nepotism,
and we will take care of their authority for them. Publish for us, you soldiers, an army gazette,
in which the one subject of daily intelligence shall be the grounds of promotion; a gazette
which shall simply tell us, what there certainly can be no detriment to the service in our
knowing, when any officer is appointed to a new command,--what his former services and successes
have been,--whom he has superseded,--and on what ground. It will be always a satisfaction to
us; it may sometimes be an advantage to you: and then, when there is really necessary debate
respecting reduction of wages, let us always begin not with the wages of the industrious classes,
but with those of the idle ones. Let there be honorary titles, if people like them; but let
there be no honorary incomes.

So much for the master's motto, "Every man in his place." Next for the laborer's motto, "Every
man his chance." Let us mend that for them a little, and say, "Every man his certainty"--certainty,
that if he does well, he will be honored, and aided, and advanced in such degree as may be
fitting for his faculty and consistent with his peace; and equal certainty that if he does
ill, he will by sure justice be judged, and by sure punishment be chastised; if it may be,
corrected; and if that may not be, condemned. That is the right reading of the Republican motto,
"Every man his chance." And then, with such a system of government, pure, watchful and just,
you may approach your great problem of national education, or in other words, of national employment.
For all education begins in work. What we think, or what we know; or what we believe, is in
the end, of little consequence. The only thing of consequence is what we do; and for man, woman,
or child, the first point of education is to make them do their best. It is the law of good
economy to make the best of everything. How much more to make the best of every creature! Therefore,
when your pauper comes to you and asks for bread, ask of him instantly--What faculty have you?
What can you do best? Can you drive a nail into wood? Go and mend the parish fences. Can you
lay a brick? Mend the walls of the cottages where the wind comes in. Can you lift a spadeful
of earth? Turn this field up three feet deep all over. Can you only drag a weight with your
shoulders? Stand at the bottom of this hill and help up the overladen horses. Can you weld
iron and chisel stone? Fortify this wreck-strewn coast into a harbor; and change these shifting
sands into fruitful ground. Wherever death was, bring life; that is to be your work; that your
parish refuge; that your education. So and no otherwise can we meet existent distress. But
for the continual education of the whole people, and for their future happiness, they must
have such consistent employment as shall develop all the powers of the fingers, and the limbs,
and the brain: and that development is only to be obtained by hand-labor, of which you have
these four great divisions--hand-labor on the earth, hand-labor on the sea, hand-labor in art,
hand-labor in war. Of the last two of these I cannot speak to-night, and of the first two only
with extreme brevity.

I. Hand-labor on the earth, the work of the husbandman and of the shepherd;--to dress the earth
and to keep the flocks of it--the first task of man, and the final one--the education always
of noblest lawgivers, kings and teachers; the education of Hesiod, of Moses, of David, of all
the true strength of Rome; and all its tenderness: the pride of Cincinnatus, and the inspiration
of Virgil. Hand-labor on the earth, and the harvest of it brought forth with singing:--not
steam-piston labor on the earth, and the harvest of it brought forth with steam-whistling.
You will have no prophet's voice accompanied by that shepherd's pipe, and pastoral symphony.
Do you know that lately, in Cumberland, in the chief pastoral district of England--in Wordsworth's
own home--a procession of villagers on their festa day provided for themselves, by way of music,
a steam-plough whistling at the head of them.

Give me patience while I put the principle of machine labor before you, as clearly and in as
short compass as possible; it is one that should be known at this juncture. Suppose a farming
proprietor needs to employ a hundred men on his estate, and that the labor of these hundred
men is enough, but not more than enough, to till all his land, and to raise from it food for
his own family, and for the hundred laborers. He is obliged, under such circumstances, to maintain
all the men in moderate comfort, and can only by economy accumulate much for himself. But,
suppose he contrive a machine that will easily do the work of fifty men, with only one man
to watch it. This sounds like a great advance in civilization. The farmer of course gets his
machine made, turns off the fifty men, who may starve or emigrate at their choice, and now
he can keep half of the produce of his estate, which formerly went to feed them, all to himself.
That is the essential and constant operation of machinery among us at this moment.

Nay, it is at first answered; no man can in reality keep half the produce of an estate to himself,
nor can he in the end keep more than his own human share of anything; his riches must diffuse
themselves at some time; he must maintain somebody else with them, however he spends them.
That is mainly true (not altogether so), for food and fuel are in ordinary circumstances personally
wasted by rich people, in quantities which would save many lives. One of my own great luxuries,
for instance, is candlelight--and I probably burn, for myself alone, as many candles during
the winter, as would comfort the old eyes, or spare the young ones, of a whole rushlighted
country village. Still, it is mainly true, that it is not by their personal waste that rich
people prevent the lives of the poor. This is the way they do it. Let me go back to my farmer.
He has got his machine made, which goes creaking, screaming, and occasionally exploding, about
modern Arcadia. He has turned off his fifty men to starve. Now, at some distance from his own
farm, there is another on which the laborers were working for their bread in the same way,
by tilling the land. The machinist sends over to these, saying--"I have got food enough for
you without your digging or ploughing any more. I can maintain you in other occupations instead
of ploughing that land; if you rake in its gravel you will find some hard stones--you shall
grind those on mills till they glitter; then, my wife shall wear a necklace of them. Also,
if you turn up the meadows below you will find some fine white clay, of which you shall make
a porcelain service for me: and the rest of the farm I want for pasture for horses for my carriage--and
you shall groom them, and some of you ride behind the carriage with staves in your hands, and
I will keep you much fatter for doing that than you can keep yourselves by digging."

Well--but it is answered, are we to have no diamonds, nor china, nor pictures, nor footmen,
then--but all to be farmers? I am not saying what we ought to do, I want only to show you with
perfect clearness first what we are doing; and that, I repeat, is the upshot of machine-contriving
in this country. And observe its effect on the national strength. Without machines, you have
a hundred and fifty yeomen ready to join for defence of the land. You get your machine, starve
fifty of them, make diamond-cutters or footmen of as many more, and for your national defence
against an enemy, you have now, and can have, only fifty men, instead of a hundred and fifty;
these also now with minds much alienated from you as their chief,[141] and the rest, lapidaries
or footmen; and a steam plough.

That is one effect of machinery; but at all events, if we have thus lost in men, we have gained
in riches; instead of happy human souls, we have at least got pictures, china, horses, and
are ourselves better off than we were before. But very often, and in much of our machine-contriving,
even that result does not follow. We are not one whit the richer for the machine, we only employ
it for our amusement. For observe, our gaining in riches depends on the men who are out of
employment consenting to be starved, or sent out of the country. But suppose they do not consent
passively to be starved, but some of them become criminals, and have to be taken charge of
and fed at a much greater cost than if they were at work, and, others, paupers, rioters, and
the like, then you attain the real outcome of modern wisdom and ingenuity. You have your hundred
men honestly at country work; but you don't like the sight of human beings in your fields;
you like better to see a smoking kettle. You pay, as an amateur, for that pleasure, and you
employ your fifty men in picking oakum, or begging, rioting, and thieving.

By hand-labor, therefore, and that alone, we are to till the ground. By hand-labor also to
plough the sea; both for food, and in commerce, and in war: not with floating kettles there
neither, but with hempen bridle, and the winds of heaven in harness. That is the way the power
of Greece rose on her Egean, the power of Venice on her Adria, of Amalfi in her blue bay, of
the Norman sea-riders from the North Cape to Sicily:--so, your own dominion also of the past.
Of the past mind you. On the Baltic and the Nile, your power is already departed. By machinery
you would advance to discovery; by machinery you would carry your commerce;--you would be engineers
instead of sailors; and instantly in the North seas you are beaten among the ice, and before
the very Gods of Nile, beaten among the sand. Agriculture, then, by the hand or by the plough
drawn only by animals; and shepherd and pastoral husbandry, are to be the chief schools of
Englishmen. And this most royal academy of all academies you have to open over all the land,
purifying your heaths and hills, and waters, and keeping them full of every kind of lovely
natural organism, in tree, herb, and living creature. All land that is waste and ugly, you
must redeem into ordered fruitfulness; all ruin, desolateness, imperfectness of hut or habitation,
you must do away with; and throughout every village and city of your English dominion there
must not be a hand that cannot find a helper, nor a heart that cannot find a comforter.

"How impossible!" I know, you are thinking. Ah! So far from impossible, it is easy, it is natural,
it is necessary, and I declare to you that, sooner or later, it must be done, at our peril.
If now our English lords of land will fix this idea steadily before them; take the people to
their hearts, trust to their loyalty, lead their labor;--then indeed there will be princes
again in the midst of us, worthy of the island throne,

    "This royal throne of kings--this sceptred isle--
    This fortress built by nature for herself
    Against infection, and the hand of war;
    This precious stone set in the silver sea;
    This happy breed of men--this little world:
    This other Eden--Demi-Paradise."

But if they refuse to do this, and hesitate and equivocate, clutching through the confused
catastrophe of all things only at what they can still keep stealthily for themselves--their
doom is nearer than even their adversaries hope, and it will be deeper than even their despisers
dream.

That, believe me, is the work you have to do in England; and out of England you have room for
everything else you care to do. Are her dominions in the world so narrow that she can find
no place to spin cotton in but Yorkshire? We may organize emigration into an infinite power.
We may assemble troops of the more adventurous and ambitious of our youth; we may send them
on truest foreign service, founding new seats of authority, and centres of thought, in uncultivated
and unconquered lands; retaining the full affection to the native country no less in our colonists
than in our armies, teaching them to maintain allegiance to their fatherland in labor no less
than in battle; aiding them with free hand in the prosecution of discovery, and the victory
over adverse natural powers; establishing seats of every manufacture in the climates and places
best fitted for it, and bringing ourselves into due alliance and harmony of skill with the
dexterities of every race, and the wisdoms of every tradition and every tongue.

And then you may make England itself the centre of the learning, of the arts, of the courtesies
and felicities of the world. Yon may cover her mountains with pasture; her plains with corn,
her valleys with the lily, and her gardens with the rose. You may bring together there in peace
the wise and the pure, and the gentle of the earth, and by their word, command through its
farthest darkness the birth of "God's first creature, which was Light." You know whose words
those are; the words of the wisest of Englishmen. He, and with him the wisest of all other
great nations, have spoken always to men of this hope, and they would not hear. Plato, in the
dialogue of Critias, his last, broken off at his death--Pindar, in passionate singing of the
fortunate islands--Virgil, in the prophetic tenth eclogue--Bacon, in his fable of the New Atlantis--More,
in the book which, too impatiently wise, became the bye-word of fools--these, all, have told
us with one voice what we should strive to attain; they not hopeless of it, but for our follies
forced, as it seems, by heaven, to tell us only partly and in parables, lest we should hear
them and obey.

Shall we never listen to the words of these wisest of men? Then listen at least to the words
of your children--let us in the lips of babes and sucklings find our strength; and see that
we do not make them mock instead of pray, when we teach them, night and morning, to ask for
what we believe never can be granted;--that the will of the Father,--which is, that His creatures
may be righteous and happy--should be done, on earth, as it is in Heaven.

NOTES ON THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF PRUSSIA.

I am often accused of inconsistency; but believe myself defensible against the charge with
respect to what I have said on nearly every subject except that of war. It is impossible for
me to write consistently of war, for the groups of facts I have gathered about it lead me to
two precisely opposite conclusions.

When I find this the case, in other matters, I am silent, till I can choose my conclusion:
but, with respect to war, I am forced to speak, by the necessities of the time; and forced
to act, one way or another. The conviction on which I act is, that it causes an incalculable
amount of avoidable human suffering, and that it ought to cease among Christian nations; and
if therefore any of my boy-friends desire to be soldiers, I try my utmost to bring them into
what I conceive to be a better mind. But, on the other hand, I know certainly that the most
beautiful characters yet developed among men have been formed in war;--that all great nations
have been warrior nations, and that the only kinds of peace which we are likely to get in the
present age are ruinous alike to the intellect, and the heart.

The lecture on "War," in this volume, addressed to young soldiers, had for its object to strengthen
their trust in the virtue of their profession. It is inconsistent with itself, in its closing
appeal to women, praying them to use their influence to bring wars to an end. And I have been
hindered from completing my long intended notes on the economy of the Kings of Prussia by continually
increasing doubt how far the machinery and discipline of war, under which they learned the
art of government, was essential for such lesson; and what the honesty and sagacity of the
Friedrich who so nobly repaired his ruined Prussia, might have done for the happiness of his
Prussia, unruined.

In war, however, or in peace, the character which Carlyle chiefly loves him for, and in which
Carlyle has shown him to differ from all kings up to this time succeeding him, is his constant
purpose to use every power entrusted to him for the good of his people; and be, not in name
only, but in heart and hand, their king.

Not in ambition, but in natural instinct of duty. Friedrich, born to govern, determines to
govern to the best of his faculty. That "best" may sometimes be unwise; and self-will, or love
of glory, may have their oblique hold on his mind, and warp it this way or that; but they are
never principal with him. He believes that war is necessary, and maintains it; sees that peace
is necessary, and calmly persists in the work of it to the day of his death, not claiming therein
more praise than the head of any ordinary household, who rules it simply because it is his
place, and he must not yield the mastery of it to another.

How far, in the future, it may be possible for men to gain the strength necessary for kingship
without either fronting death, or inflicting it, seems to me not at present determinable. The
historical facts are that, broadly speaking, none but soldiers, or persons with a soldierly
faculty, have ever yet shown themselves fit to be kings; and that no other men are so gentle,
so just, or so clear-sighted. Wordsworth's character of the happy warrior cannot be reached
in the height of it but by a warrior; nay, so much is it beyond common strength that I had
supposed the entire meaning of it to be metaphorical, until one of the best soldiers of England
himself read me the poem,[142] and taught me, what I might have known, had I enough watched
his own life, that it was entirely literal. There is nothing of so high reach distinctly demonstrable
in Friedrich: but I see more and more, as I grow older, that the things which are the most
worth, encumbered among the errors and faults of every man's nature, are never clearly demonstrable;
and are often most forcible when they are scarcely distinct to his own conscience,--how much
less, clamorous for recognition by others!

Nothing can be more beautiful than Carlyle's showing of this, to any careful reader of Friedrich.
But careful readers are but one in the thousand; and by the careless, the masses of detail
with which the historian must deal are insurmountable.

My own notes, made for the special purpose of hunting down the one point of economy, though
they cruelly spoil Carlyle's own current and method of thought, may yet be useful in enabling
readers, unaccustomed to books involving so vast a range of conception, to discern what, on
this one subject only, may be gathered from that history. On any other subject of importance,
similar gatherings might be made of other passages. The historian has to deal with all at once.

I therefore have determined to print here, as a sequel to the Essay on War, my notes from the
first volume of Friedrich, on the economies of Brandenburg, up to the date of the establishment
of the Prussian monarchy. The economies of the first three Kings of Prussia I shall then take
up in Fors Clavigera, finding them fitter for examination in connection with the subject of
that book than of this.

I assume, that the reader will take down his first volume of Carlyle, and read attentively
the passages to which I refer him. I give the reference first to the largest edition, in six
volumes (1858-1865); then, in parenthesis, to the smallest or "people's edition" (1872-1873).
The pieces which I have quoted in my own text are for the use of readers who may not have ready
access to the book; and are enough for the explanation of the points to which I wish them to
direct their thoughts in reading such histories of soldiers or soldier-kingdoms.

I.

Year 928 to 936.--Dawn of Order in Christian Germany.

Book II. Chap. i. p. 67 (47).

Henry the Fowler, "the beginning of German kings," is a mighty soldier in the cause of peace;
his essential work the building and organization of fortified towns for the protection of men.

Read page 72 with utmost care (51), "He fortified towns," to end of small print. I have added
some notes on the matter in my lecture on Giovanni Pisano; but whether you can glance at them
or not, fix in your mind this institution of truly civil or civic building in Germany, as distinct
from the building of baronial castles for the security of robbers: and of a standing army consisting
of every ninth man, called a "burgher" ("townsman")--a soldier, appointed to learn that profession
that he may guard the walls--the exact reverse of our notion of a burgher.

Frederick's final idea of his army is, indeed, only this.

Brannibor, a chief fortress of the Wends, is thus taken, and further strengthened by Henry
the Fowler; wardens appointed for it; and thus the history of Brandenburg begins. On all frontiers,
also, this "beginning of German kings" has his "Markgraf." "Ancient of the marked place." Read
page 73, measuredly, learning it by heart, if it may be. (51-2.)

II.

936-1000.--History of Nascent Brandenburg.

The passage I last desired you to read ends with this sentence: "The sea-wall you build, and
what main floodgates you establish in it, will depend on the state of the outer sea."

From this time forward you have to keep clearly separate in your minds, (A) the history of
that outer sea, Pagan Scandinavia, Russia, and Bor-Russia, or Prussia proper; (B) the history
of Henry the Fowler's Eastern and Western Marches; asserting themselves gradually as Austria
and the Netherlands; and (C) the history of this inconsiderable fortress of Brandenburg, gradually
becoming considerable, and the capital city of increasing district between them. That last
history, however, Carlyle is obliged to leave vague and gray for two hundred years after Henry's
death. Absolutely dim for the first century, in which nothing is evident but that its wardens
or Markgraves had no peaceable possession of the place. Read the second paragraph in page 74
(52-3), "in old books" to "reader," and the first in page 83 (59) "meanwhile" to "substantial,"
consecutively. They bring the story of Brandenburg itself down, at any rate, from 936 to 1000.

III.

936-1000.--State of the Outer Sea.

Read now Chapter II. beginning at page 76 (54), wherein you will get account of the beginning
of vigorous missionary work on the outer sea, in Prussia proper; of the death of St. Adalbert,
and of the purchase of his dead body by the Duke of Poland.

You will not easily understand Carlyle's laugh in this chapter, unless you have learned yourself
to laugh in sadness, and to laugh in love.

"No Czech blows his pipe in the woodlands without certain precautions and preliminary fuglings
of a devotional nature." (Imagine St. Adalbert, in spirit, at the railway station in Birmingham!)

My own main point for notice in the chapter is the purchase of his body for its "weight in
gold." Swindling angels held it up in the scales; it did not weigh so much as a web of gossamer.
"Had such excellent odor, too, and came for a mere nothing of gold," says Carlyle. It is one
of the first commercial transactions of Germany, but I regret the conduct of the angels on
the occasion. Evangelicalism has been proud of ceasing to invest in relics, its swindling angels
helping it to better things, as it supposes. For my own part, I believe Christian Germany could
not have bought at this time any treasure more precious; nevertheless, the missionary work
itself you find is wholly vain. The difference of opinion between St. Adalbert and the Wends,
on Divine matters, does not signify to the Fates. They will not have it disputed about; and
end the dispute adversely, to St. Adalbert--adversely, even, to Brandenburg and its civilizing
power, as you will immediately see.

IV.

1000-1030.--History of Brandenburg in Trouble.

Book II. Chap. iii. p. 83 (59).

The adventures of Brandenburg in contest with Pagan Prussia, irritated, rather than amended,
by St. Adalbert. In 1023, roughly, a hundred years after Henry the Fowler's death, Brandenburg
is taken by the Wends, and its first line of Markgraves ended; its population mostly butchered,
especially the priests; and the Wends' God, Triglaph, "something like three whales' cubs combined
by boiling," set up on the top of St. Mary's Hill.

Here is an adverse "Doctrine of the Trinity" which has its supporters! It is wonderful,--this
Tripod and Triglyph--three-footed, three-cut faith of the North and South, the leaf of the
oxalis, and strawberry, and clover, fostering the same in their simple manner. I suppose it
to be the most savage and natural of notions about Deity; a prismatic idol-shape of Him, rude
as a triangular log, as a trefoil grass. I do not find how long Triglaph held his state on
St. Mary's Hill. "For a time," says Carlyle, "the priests all slain or fled--shadowy Markgraves
the like--church and state lay in ashes, and Triglaph, like a triple porpoise under the influence
of laudanum, stood, I know not whether on his head or his tail, aloft on the Harlungsberg,
as the Supreme of this Universe for the time being."

V.

1030-1130.--Brandenburg under the Ditmarsch Markgraves, or Ditmarsch-Stade Markgraves.

Book II. Chap. iii. p. 85 (60).

Of Anglish, or Saxon breed. They attack Brandenburg, under its Triglyphic protector, take it--dethrone
him, and hold the town for a hundred years, their history "stamped beneficially on the face
of things, Markgraf after Markgraf getting killed in the business. 'Erschlagen,' 'slain,' fighting
with the Heathen--say the old books, and pass on to another." If we allow seven years to Triglaph--we
get a clear century for these--as above indicated. They die out in 1130.

VI.

1130-1170.--Brandenburg under Albert the Bear.

Book II. Chap iv. p. 91 (64).

He is the first of the Ascanien Markgraves, whose castle of Ascanica is on the northern slope
of the Hartz Mountains, "ruins still dimly traceable."

There had been no soldier or king of note among the Ditmarsch Markgraves, so that you will
do well to fix in your mind successively the three men, Henry the Fowler, St. Adalbert, and
Albert the Bear. A soldier again, and a strong one. Named the Bear only from the device on
his shield, first wholly definite Markgraf of Brandenburg that there is, "and that the luckiest
of events for Brandenburg." Read page 93 (66) carefully, and note this of his economies.

       *       *       *       *       *

Nothing better is known to me of Albert the Bear than his introducing large numbers of Dutch
Netherlanders into those countries; men thrown out of work, who already knew how to deal with
bog and sand, by mixing and delving, and who first taught Brandenburg what greenness and cow-pasture
was. The Wends, in presence of such things, could not but consent more and more to efface themselves--either
to become German, and grow milk and cheese in the Dutch manner, or to disappear from the world.

       *       *       *       *       *

After two-hundred and fifty years of barking and worrying, the Wends are now finally reduced
to silence; their anarchy well buried and wholesome Dutch cabbage planted over it; Albert did
several great things in the world; but this, for posterity, remains his memorable feat. Not
done quite easily, but done: big destinies of nations or of persons are not founded gratis
in this world, He had a sore, toilsome time of it, coercing, warring, managing among his fellow-creatures,
while his day's work lasted--fifty years or so, for it began early. He died in his castle of
Ballenstädt, peaceably among the Hartz Mountains at last, in the year 1170, age about sixty-five.

       *       *       *       *       *

Now, note in all this the steady gain of soldiership enforcing order and agriculture, with
St. Adalbert giving higher strain to the imagination. Henry the Fowler establishes walled towns,
fighting for mere peace. Albert the Bear plants the country with cabbages, fighting for his
cabbage-fields. And the disciples of St. Adalbert, generally, have succeeded in substituting
some idea of Christ for the idea of Triglaph. Some idea only; other ideas than of Christ haunt
even to this day those Hartz Mountains among which Albert the Bear dies so peacefully. Mephistopheles,
and all his ministers, inhabit there, commanding mephitic clouds and earth-born dreams.

VII.

1170-1320.--Brandenburg 150 years under the Ascanien Markgraves.

Vol. I. Book II Chap. viii. p. 135 (96).

"Wholesome Dutch cabbages continued to be more and more planted by them in the waste sand:
intrusive chaos, and Triglaph held at bay by them," till at last in 1240, seventy years after
the great Bear's death, they fortify a new Burg, a "little rampart," Wehrlin, diminutive of
Wehr (or vallum), gradually smoothing itself, with a little echo of the Bear in it too, into
Ber-lin, the oily river Spree flowing by, "in which you catch various fish;" while trade over
the flats and by the dull streams, is widely possible. Of the Ascanien race, the notablest
is Otto with the Arrow, whose story see, pp. 138-141 (98-100), noting that Otto is one of the
first Minnesingers; that, being a prisoner to the Archbishop of Magdeburg, his wife rescues
him, selling her jewels to bribe the canons; and that the Knight, set free on parole and promise
of farther ransom, rides back with his own price in his hand; holding himself thereat cheaply
bought, though no angelic legerdemain happens to the scales now. His own estimate of his price--"Rain
gold ducats on my war-horse and me, till you cannot see the point of my spear atop."

Emptiness of utter pride, you think?

Not so. Consider with yourself, reader, how much you dare to say, aloud, you are worth. If
you have no courage to name any price whatsoever for yourself, believe me, the cause is not
your modesty, but that in very truth you feel in your heart there would be no bid for you at
Lucian's sale of lives, were that again possible, at Christie and Manson's.

Finally (1319 exactly; say 1320, for memory), the Ascanien line expired in Brandenburg, and
the little town and its electorate lapsed to the Kaiser: meantime other economical arrangements
had been in progress; but observe first how far we have got.

The Fowler, St. Adalbert and the Bear have established order, and some sort of Christianity;
but the established persons begin to think somewhat too well of themselves. On quite honest
terms, a dead saint or a living knight ought to be worth their true "weight in gold." But a
pyramid, with only the point of the spear seen at top, would be many times over one's weight
in gold. And although men were yet far enough from the notion of modern days, that the gold
is better than the flesh, and from buying it with the clay of one's body, and even the fire
of one's soul, instead of soul and body with it, they were beginning to fight for their own
supremacy, or for their own religious fancies, and not at all to any useful end, until an entirely
unexpected movement is made in the old useful direction forsooth, only by some kind ship-captains
of Lübeck!

VIII.

1210-1320.--Civil work, aiding military, during the Ascanien period.

Vol. I. Book II. Chap. vi. p. 109 (77).

In the year 1190, Acre not yet taken, and the crusading army wasting by murrain on the shore,
the German soldiers especially having none to look after them, certain compassionate ship-captains
of Lübeck, one Walpot von Bassenheim taking the lead, formed themselves into an union for succor
of the sick and the dying, set up canvas tents from the Lübeck ship stores, and did what utmost
was in them silently in the name of mercy and heaven. Finding its work prosper, the little
medicinal and weather-fending company took vows on itself, strict chivalry forms, and decided
to become permanent "Knights Hospitallers of our dear Lady of Mount Zion," separate from the
former Knights Hospitallers, as being entirely German: yet soon, as the German Order of St.
Mary, eclipsing in importance Templars, Hospitallers, and every other chivalric order then
extant; no purpose of battle in them, but much strength for it; their purpose only the helping
of German pilgrims. To this only they are bound by their vow, "gelübde," and become one of
the usefullest of clubs in all the Pall Mall of Europe.

Finding pilgrimage in Palestine falling slack, and more need for them on the homeward side
of the sea, their Hochmeister, Hermann of the Salza, goes over to Venice in 1210. There the
titular bishop of still unconverted Preussen advises him of that field of work for his idle
knights. Hermann thinks well of it: sets his St. Mary's riders at Triglaph, with the sword
in one hand and a missal in the other.

Not your modern way of affecting conversion! Too illiberal, you think; and what would Mr. J.
S. Mill say?

But if Triglaph had been verily "three whales' cubs combined by boiling," you would yourself
have promoted attack upon him for the sake of his oil, would not you? The Teutsch Ritters,
fighting him for charity, are they so much inferior to you?

       *       *       *       *       *

They built, and burnt, innumerable stockades for and against; built wooden forts which are
now stone towns. They fought much and prevalently; galloped desperately to and fro, ever on
the alert. In peaceabler ulterior times, they fenced in the Nogat and the Weichsel with dams,
whereby unlimited quagmire might become grassy meadow--as it continues to this day. Marienburg
(Mary's Burg), with its grand stone Schloss still visible and even habitable: this was at length
their headquarter. But how many Burgs of wood and stone they built, in different parts; what
revolts, surprisals, furious fights in woody, boggy places they had, no man has counted.

But always some preaching by zealous monks, accompanied the chivalrous fighting. And colonists
came in from Germany; trickling in, or at times streaming. Victorious Ritterdom offers terms
to the beaten heathen: terms not of tolerant nature, but which will be punctually kept by Ritterdom.
When the flame of revolt or general conspiracy burnt up again too extensively, high personages
came on crusade to them. Ottocar, King of Bohemia, with his extensive far-shining chivalry,
"conquered Samland in a month;" tore up the Romova where Adalbert had been massacred, and burned
it from the face of the earth. A certain fortress was founded at that time, in Ottocar's presence;
and in honor of him they named it King's Fortress, "Königsberg." Among King Ottocar's esquires,
or subaltern junior officials, on this occasion, is one Rudolf, heir of a poor Swiss lordship
and gray hill castle, called Hapsburg, rather in reduced circumstances, whom Ottocar likes
for his prudent, hardy ways; a stout, modest, wise young man, who may chance to redeem Hapsburg
a little, if he lives.

Conversion, and complete conquest once come, there was a happy time for Prussia; ploughshare
instead of sword: busy sea-havens, German towns, getting built; churches everywhere rising;
grass growing, and peaceable cows, where formerly had been quagmire and snakes, and for the
Order a happy time. On the whole, this Teutsch Ritterdom, for the first century and more, was
a grand phenomenon, and flamed like a bright blessed beacon through the night of things, in
those Northern countries. For above a century, we perceive, it was the rallying place of all
brave men who had a career to seek on terms other than vulgar. The noble soul, aiming beyond
money, and sensible to more than hunger in this world, had a beacon burning (as we say), if
the night chanced to overtake it, and the earth to grow too intricate, as is not uncommon.
Better than the career of stump-oratory, I should fancy, and its Hesperides apples, golden,
and of gilt horse-dung. Better than puddling away one's poor spiritual gift of God (loan, not
gift), such as it may be, in building the lofty rhyme, the lofty review article, for a discerning
public that has sixpence to spare! Times alter greatly.[143]

       *       *       *       *       *

We must pause here again for a moment to think where we are, and who is with us. The Teutsch
Ritters have been fighting, independently of all states, for their own hand, or St. Adalbert's;
partly for mere love of fight, partly for love of order, partly for love of God. Meantime,
other Riders have been fighting wholly for what they could get by it; and other persons, not
Riders, have not been fighting at all, but in their own towns peacefully manufacturing and selling.

Of Henry the Fowler's Marches, Austria has become a military power, Flanders a mercantile one,
pious only in the degree consistent with their several occupations. Prussia is now a practical
and farming country, more Christian than its longer-converted neighbors.

       *       *       *       *       *

Towns are built, Königsberg (King Ottocar's town), Thoren (Thorn, City of the Gates), with
many others; so that the wild population and the tame now lived tolerably together, under Gospel
and Lübeck law; and all was ploughing and trading.

       *       *       *       *       *

But Brandenburg itself, what of it?

The Ascanien Markgraves rule it on the whole prosperously down to 1320, when their line expires,
and it falls into the power of Imperial Austria.

IX.

1320-1415.--Brandenburg under the Austrians.

A century--the fourteenth--of miserable anarchy and decline for Brandenburg, its Kurfürsts,
in deadly succession, making what they can out of it for their own pockets. The city itself
and its territory utterly helpless. Read pp. 180, 181 (129, 130). "The towns suffered much,
any trade they might have had going to wreck. Robber castles flourished, all else decayed,
no highway safe. What are Hamburg pedlars made for but to be robbed?"

X.

1415-1440.--Brandenburg under Friedrich of Nüremberg.

This is the fourth of the men whom you are to remember as creators of the Prussian monarchy,
Henry the Fowler, St. Adalbert, Albert the Bear, of Ascanien, and Friedrich of Nüremberg; (of
Hohenzollern, by name, and by country, of the Black Forest, north of the Lake of Constance).

Brandenburg is sold to him at Constance, during the great Council, for about 200,000l. of our
money, worth perhaps a million in that day; still, with its capabilities, "dog cheap." Admitting,
what no one at the time denied, the general marketableness of states as private property, this
is the one practical result, thinks Carlyle (not likely to think wrong), of that oecumenical
deliberation, four years long, of the "elixir of the intellect and dignity of Europe. And that
one thing was not its doing; but a pawnbroking job, intercalated," putting, however, at last,
Brandenburg again under the will of one strong man. On St. John's day, 1412, he first set foot
in his town, "and Brandenburg, under its wise Kurfürst, begins to be cosmic again." The story
of Heavy Peg, pages 195-198 (138, 140), is one of the most brilliant and important passages
of the first volume; page 199, specially to our purpose, must be given entire:--

     The offer to be Kaiser was made him in his old days; but he
     wisely declined that too. It was in Brandenburg, by what he
     silently founded there, that he did his chief benefit to
     Germany and mankind. He understood the noble art of
     governing men; had in him the justness, clearness, valor,
     and patience needed for that. A man of sterling probity, for
     one thing. Which indeed is the first requisite in said
     art:--if you will have your laws obeyed without mutiny, see
     well that they be pieces of God Almighty's law; otherwise
     all the artillery in the world will not keep down mutiny.

     Friedrich "travelled much over Brandenburg;" looking into
     everything with his own eyes; making, I can well fancy,
     innumerable crooked things straight; reducing more and more
     that famishing dog-kennel of a Brandenburg into a fruitful
     arable field. His portraits represent a square-headed,
     mild-looking, solid gentleman, with a certain twinkle of
     mirth in the serious eyes of him. Except in those Hussite
     wars for Kaiser Sigismund and the Reich, in which no man
     could prosper, he may be defined as constantly prosperous.
     To Brandenburg he was, very literally, the blessing of
     blessings; redemption out of death into life. In the ruins
     of that old Friesack Castle, battered down by Heavy Peg,
     antiquarian science (if it had any eyes) might look for the
     taproot of the Prussian nation, and the beginning of all
     that Brandenburg has since grown to under the sun.

Which growth is now traced by Carlyle in its various budding and withering, under the succession
of the twelve Electors, of whom Friedrich, with his heavy Peg, is first, and Friedrich, first
King of Prussia, grandfather of Friedrich the Great, the twelfth.

XI.

1416-1701.--Brandenburg under the Hohenzollern Kurfürsts.

Book III.

Who the Hohenzollerns were, and how they came to power in Nüremberg, is told in Chap. v. of
Book II.

Their succession in Brandenburg is given in brief at page 377 (269). I copy it, in absolute
barrenness of enumeration, for our momentary convenience, here:

    Friedrich 1st of Brandenburg (6th of Nüremberg), 1412-1440
    Friedrich II., called "Iron Teeth,"              1440-1472
    Albert,                                          1472-1486
    Johann,                                          1486-1499
    Joachim I.,                                      1499-1535
    Joachim II.,                                     1535-1571
    Johann George,                                   1571-1598
    Joachim Friedrich,                               1598-1608
    Johann Sigismund,                                1608-1619
    George Wilhelm,                                  1619-1640
    Friedrich Wilhelm (the Great Elector),           1640-1688
    Friedrich, first King; crowned 18th January,       1701

Of this line of princes we have to say they followed generally in their ancestor's steps, and
had success of the like kind more or less; Hohenzollerns all of them, by character and behaviour
as well as by descent. No lack of quiet energy, of thrift, sound sense. There was likewise
solid fair-play in general, no founding of yourself on ground that will not carry, and there
was instant, gentle, but inexorable crushing of mutiny, if it showed itself, which after the
Second Elector, or at most the Third, it had altogether ceased to do.

This is the general account of them; of special matters note the following:--

II. Friedrich, called "Iron-teeth," from his firmness, proves a notable manager and governor.
Builds the palace at Berlin in its first form, and makes it his chief residence. Buys Neumark
from the fallen Teutsch Ritters, and generally establishes things on securer footing.

III. Albert, "a fiery, tough old Gentlemen," called the Achilles of Germany in his day; has
half-a-century of fighting with his own Nürembergers, with Bavaria, France, Burgundy, and its
fiery Charles, besides being head constable to the Kaiser among any disorderly persons in the
East. His skull, long shown on his tomb, "marvellous for strength and with no visible sutures."

IV. John, the orator of his race; (but the orations unrecorded). His second son, Archbishop
of Maintz, for whose piece of memorable work see page 223 (143) and read in connection with
that the history of Margraf George, pp. 237-241 (152-154), and the 8th chapter of the third book.

V. Joachim I., of little note; thinks there has been enough Reformation, and checks proceedings
in a dull stubbornness, causing him at least grave domestic difficulties.--Page 271 (173).

VI. Joachim II. Again active in the Reformation, and staunch,

     though generally in a cautious, weighty, never in a rash,
     swift way, to the great cause of Protestantism and to all
     good causes. He was himself a solemnly devout man; deep,
     awe-stricken reverence dwelling in his view of this
     universe. Most serious, though with a jocose dialect,
     commonly having a cheerful wit in speaking to men. Luther's
     books he called his Seelenschatz, (soul's treasure); Luther
     and the Bible were his chief reading. Fond of profane
     learning, too, and of the useful or ornamental arts; given
     to music, and "would himself sing aloud" when he had a
     melodious leisure hour.

VII. Johann George, a prudent thrifty Herr; no mistresses, no luxuries allowed; at the sight
of a new-fashioned coat he would fly out on an unhappy youth and pack him from his presence.
Very strict in point of justice; a peasant once appealing to him in one of his inspection journeys
through the country--

     "Grant me justice, Durchlaucht, against so and so; I am your
     Highness's born subject." "Thou shouldst have it, man, wert
     thou a born Turk!" answered Johann George.

Thus, generally, we find this line of Electors representing in Europe the Puritan mind of England
in a somewhat duller, but less dangerous, form; receiving what Protestantism could teach of
honesty and common sense, but not its anti-Catholic fury, or its selfish spiritual anxiety.
Pardon of sins is not to be had from Tetzel; neither, the Hohenzollern mind advises with itself,
from even Tetzel's master, for either the buying, or the asking. On the whole, we had better
commit as few as possible, and live just lives and plain ones.

     A conspicuous thrift, veracity, modest solidity, looks
     through the conduct of this Herr; a determined Protestant he
     too, as indeed all the following were and are.

VIII. Joachim Friedrich. Gets hold of Prussia, which hitherto, you observe, has always been
spoken of as a separate country from Brandenburg. March 11, 1605--"squeezed his way into the
actual guardianship of Preussen and its imbecile Duke, which was his by right."

For my own part, I do not trouble myself much about these rights, never being able to make
out any single one, to begin with, except the right to keep everything and every place about
you in as good order as you can--Prussia, Poland, or what else. I should much like, for instance,
just now, to hear of any honest Cornish gentleman of the old Drake breed taking a fancy to
land in Spain, and trying what he could make of his rights as far round Gibraltar as he could
enforce them. At all events, Master Joachim has somehow got hold of Prussia; and means to keep it.

IX. Johann Sigismund. Only notable for our economical purposes, as getting the "guardianship"
of Prussia confirmed to him. The story at page 317 (226), "a strong flame of choler," indicates
a new order of things among the knights of Europe--"princely etiquettes melting all into smoke."
Too literally so, that being one of the calamitous functions of the plain lives we are living,
and of the busy life our country is living. In the Duchy of Cleve, especially, concerning which
legal dispute begins in Sigismund's time. And it is well worth the lawyers' trouble, it seems.

     It amounted, perhaps, to two Yorkshires in extent. A
     naturally opulent country of fertile meadows, shipping
     capabilities, metalliferous hills, and at this time, in
     consequence of the Dutch-Spanish war, and the multitude of
     Protestant refugees, it was getting filled with ingenious
     industries, and rising to be what it still is, the busiest
     quarter of Germany. A country lowing with kine; the hum of
     the flax-spindle heard in its cottages in those old
     days--"much of the linen called Hollands is made in Jülich,
     and only bleached, stamped, and sold by the Dutch," says
     Büsching. A country in our days which is shrouded at short
     intervals with the due canopy of coal-smoke, and loud with
     sounds of the anvil and the loom.

The lawyers took two hundred and six years to settle the question concerning this Duchy, and
the thing Johann Sigismund had claimed legally in 1609 was actually handed over to Johann Sigismund's
descendant in the seventh generation. "These litigated duchies are now the Prussian provinces,
Jülich, Berg, Cleve, and the nucleus of Prussia's possessions in the Rhine country."

X. George Wilhelm. Read pp. 325 to 327 (231, 233) on this Elector and German Protestantism,
now fallen cold, and somewhat too little dangerous. But George Wilhelm is the only weak prince
of all the twelve. For another example how the heart and life of a country depend upon its
prince, not on its council, read this, of Gustavus Adolphus, demanding the cession of Spandau
and Küstrin:

     Which cession Kurfürst George Wilhelm, though giving all his
     prayers to the good cause, could by no means grant. Gustav
     had to insist, with more and more emphasis, advancing at
     last with military menace upon Berlin itself. He was met by
     George Wilhelm and his Council, "in the woods of Cöpenick,"
     short way to the east of that city; there George Wilhelm and
     his Council wandered about, sending messages, hopelessly
     consulting, saying among each other, "Que faire? ils ont des
     canons." For many hours so, round the inflexible Gustav, who
     was there like a fixed mile-stone, and to all questions and
     comers had only one answer.

On our special question of war and its consequences, read this of the Thirty Years' one:

     But on the whole, the grand weapon in it, and towards the
     latter times, the exclusive one, was hunger. The opposing
     armies tried to starve one another; at lowest, tried each
     not to starve. Each trying to eat the country or, at any
     rate, to leave nothing eatable in it; what that will mean
     for the country we may consider. As the armies too
     frequently, and the Kaiser's armies habitually, lived
     without commissariat, often enough without pay, all horrors
     of war and of being a seat of war, that have been since
     heard of, are poor to those then practised, the detail of
     which is still horrible to read. Germany, in all eatable
     quarters of it, had to undergo the process; tortured, torn
     to pieces, wrecked, and brayed as in a mortar, under the
     iron mace of war. Brandenburg saw its towns seized and
     sacked, its country populations driven to despair by the one
     party and the other. Three times--first in the
     Wallenstein-Mecklenburg times, while fire and sword were the
     weapons, and again, twice over, in the ultimate stages of
     the struggle, when starvation had become the
     method--Brandenburg fell to be the principal theatre of
     conflict, where all forms of the dismal were at their
     height. In 1638, three years after that precious "Peace of
     Prag,"... the ravages of the starving Gallas and his
     Imperialists excelled all precedent,... men ate human flesh,
     nay, human creatures ate their own children. "Que faire? ils
     ont des canons!"

"We have now arrived at the lowest nadir point" (says Carlyle) "of the history of Brandenburg
under the Hohenzollerns." Is this then all that Heavy Peg and our nine Kurfürsts have done for us?

Carlyle does not mean that; but even he, greatest of historians since Tacitus, is not enough
careful to mark for us the growth of national character, as distinct from the prosperity of
dynasties.

A republican historian would think of this development only, and suppose it to be possible
without any dynasties.

Which is indeed in a measure so, and the work now chiefly needed in moral philosophy, as well
as history, is an analysis of the constant and prevalent, yet unthought of, influences, which,
without any external help from kings, and in a silent and entirely necessary manner, form,
in Sweden, in Bavaria, in the Tyrol, in the Scottish border, and on the French sea-coast, races
of noble peasants; pacific, poetic, heroic, Christian-hearted in the deepest sense, who may
indeed perish by sword or famine in any cruel thirty years' war, or ignoble thirty years' peace,
and yet leave such strength to their children that the country, apparently ravaged into hopeless
ruin, revives, under any prudent king, as the cultivated fields do under the spring rain. How
the rock to which no seed can cling, and which no rain can soften, is subdued into the good
ground which can bring forth its hundredfold, we forget to watch, while we follow the footsteps
of the sower, or mourn the catastrophes of storm. All this while, the Prussian earth--the Prussian
soul--has been thus dealt upon by successive fate; and now, though laid, as it seems, utterly
desolate, it can be revived by a few years of wisdom and of peace.

Vol. I. Book III. Chap, xviii.--The Great Elector, Friedrich Wilhelm. Eleventh of the dynasty:--

     There hardly ever came to sovereign power a young man of
     twenty under more distressing, hopeless-looking
     circumstances. Political significance Brandenburg had none;
     a mere Protestant appendage, dragged about by a Papist
     Kaiser. His father's Prime Minister, as we have seen, was in
     the interest of his enemies; not Brandenburg's servant, but
     Austria's. The very commandants of his fortresses,
     Commandant of Spandau more especially, refused to obey
     Friedrich Wilhelm on his accession; "were bound to obey the
     Kaiser in the first place."

     For twenty years past Brandenburg had been scoured by
     hostile armies, which, especially the Kaiser's part of
     which, committed outrages new in human history. In a year or
     two hence, Brandenburg became again the theatre of business,
     Austrian Gallas advancing thither again (1644) with intent
     "to shut up Torstenson and his Swedes in Jutland." Gallas
     could by no means do what he intended; on the contrary, he
     had to run from Torstenson--what feet could do; was hunted,
     he and his Merode Brüder (beautiful inventors of the
     "marauding" art), till they pretty much all died (crepirten)
     says Köhler. No great loss to society, the death of these
     artists, but we can fancy what their life, and especially
     what the process of their dying, may have cost poor
     Brandenburg again!

     Friedrich Wilhelm's aim, in this as in other emergencies,
     was sun-clear to himself, but for most part dim to everybody
     else. He had to walk very warily, Sweden on one hand of him,
     suspicious Kaiser on the other: he had to wear semblances,
     to be ready with evasive words, and advance noiselessly by
     many circuits. More delicate operation could not be
     imagined. But advance he did; advance and arrive. With
     extraordinary talent, diligence, and felicity the young man
     wound himself out of this first fatal position, got those
     foreign armies pushed out of his country, and kept them out.
     His first concern had been to find some vestige of revenue,
     to put that upon a clear footing, and by loans or otherwise
     to scrape a little ready-money together. On the strength of
     which a small body of soldiers could be collected about him,
     and drilled into real ability to fight and obey. This as a
     basis: on this followed all manner of things, freedom from
     Swedish-Austrian invasions, as the first thing. He was
     himself, as appeared by-and-by, a fighter of the first
     quality, when it came to that; but never was willing to
     fight if he could help it. Preferred rather to shift,
     manoeuvre, and negotiate, which he did in most vigilant,
     adroit, and masterly manner. But by degrees he had grown to
     have, and could maintain it, an army of twenty-four thousand
     men, among the best troops then in being.

To wear semblances, to be ready with evasive words, how is this, Mr. Carlyle? thinks perhaps
the rightly thoughtful reader.

Yes, such things have to be; There are lies and lies, and there are truths and truths. Ulysses
cannot ride on the ram's back, like Phryxus; but must ride under his belly. Read also this,
presently following:

     Shortly after which, Friedrich Wilhelm, who had shone much
     in the battle of Warsaw, into which he was dragged against
     his will, changed sides. An inconsistent, treacherous man?
     Perhaps not, O reader! perhaps a man advancing "in
     circuits," the only way he has; spirally, face now to east,
     now to west, with his own reasonable private aim sun-clear
     to him all the while?

The battle of Warsaw, three days long, fought with Gustavus, the grandfather of Charles XII.,
against the Poles, virtually ends the Polish power:

     Old Johann Casimir, not long after that peace of Oliva,
     getting tired of his unruly Polish chivalry and their ways,
     abdicated--retired to Paris, and "and lived much with Ninon
     de l'Enclos and her circle," for the rest of his life. He
     used to complain of his Polish chivalry, that there was no
     solidity in them; nothing but outside glitter, with tumult
     and anarchic noise; fatal want of one essential talent, the
     talent of obeying; and has been heard to prophesy that a
     glorious Republic, persisting in such courses, would arrive
     at results which would surprise it.

     Onward from this time, Friedrich Wilhelm figures in the
     world; public men watching his procedure; kings anxious to
     secure him--Dutch print-sellers sticking up his portraits
     for a hero-worshipping public. Fighting hero, had the public
     known it, was not his essential character, though he had to
     fight a great deal. He was essentially an industrial man;
     great in organizing, regulating, in constraining chaotic
     heaps to become cosmic for him. He drains bogs, settles
     colonies in the waste places of his dominions, cuts canals;
     unweariedly encourages trade and work. The Friedrich
     Wilhelm's Canal, which still carries tonnage from the Oder
     to the Spree, is a monument of his zeal in this way;
     creditable with the means he had. To the poor French
     Protestants in the Edict-of-Nantes affair, he was like an
     express benefit of Heaven; one helper appointed to whom the
     help itself was profitable. He munificently welcomed them
     to Brandenburg; showed really a noble piety and human pity,
     as well as judgment; nor did Brandenburg and he want their
     reward. Some twenty thousand nimble French souls, evidently
     of the best French quality, found a home there; made "waste
     sands about Berlin into potherb gardens;" and in spiritual
     Brandenburg, too, did something of horticulture which is
     still noticeable.

Now read carefully the description of the man, p. 352 (224-5); the story of the battle of Fehrbellin,
"the Marathon of Brandenburg," p. 354 (225); and of the winter campaign of 1679, p. 356 (227),
beginning with its week's marches at sixty miles a day; his wife, as always, being with him;

     Louisa, honest and loving Dutch girl, aunt to our William of
     Orange, who trimmed up her own "Orange-burg"
     (country-house), twenty miles north of Berlin, into a little
     jewel of the Dutch type, potherb gardens, training-schools
     for young girls, and the like, a favorite abode of hers when
     she was at liberty for recreation. But her life was busy and
     earnest; she was helpmate, not in name only, to an ever busy
     man. They were married young; a marriage of love withal.
     Young Friedrich Wilhelm's courtship; wedding in Holland; the
     honest, trustful walk and conversation of the two sovereign
     spouses, their journeyings together, their mutual hopes,
     fears, and manifold vicissitudes, till death, with stern
     beauty, shut it in; all is human, true, and wholesome in it,
     interesting to look upon, and rare among sovereign persons.

Louisa died in 1667, twenty-one years before her husband, who married again--(little to his
contentment)--died in 1688; and Louisa's second son, Friedrich, ten years old at his mother's
death, and now therefore thirty-one, succeeds, becoming afterwards Friedrich I. of Prussia.

And here we pause on two great questions. Prussia is assuredly at this point a happier and
better country than it was, when inhabited by Wends. But is Friedrich I. a happier and better
man than Henry the Fowler? Have all these kings thus improved their country, but never themselves?
Is this somewhat expensive and ambitious Herr, Friedrich I. buttoned in diamonds, indeed the
best that Protestantism can produce, as against Fowlers, Bears, and Red Beards? Much more,
Friedrich Wilhelm, orthodox on predestination; most of all, his less orthodox son;--have we,
in these, the highest results which Dr. Martin Luther can produce for the present, in the first
circles of society? And if not, how is it that the country, having gained so much in intelligence
and strength, lies more passively in their power than the baser country did under that of nobler
men?

These, and collateral questions, I mean to work out as I can, with Carlyle's good help;--but
must pause for this time; in doubt, as heretofore. Only of this one thing I doubt not, that
the name of all great kings, set over Christian nations, must at last be, in fufilment, the
hereditary one of these German princes, "Rich in Peace;" and that their coronation will be
with Wild olive, not with gold.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

I have seldom been more disappointed by the result of my best pains given to any of my books,
than by the earnest request of my publisher, after the opinion of the public had been taken
on the 'Ethics of the Dust,' that I would "write no more in dialogue!" However, I bowed to
public judgment in this matter at once, (knowing also my inventive powers to be of the feeblest,);
but in reprinting the book, (at the prevailing request of my kind friend, Mr. Henry Willett,)
I would pray the readers whom it may at first offend by its disconnected method, to examine,
nevertheless, with care, the passages in which the principal speaker sums the conclusions of
any dialogue: for these summaries were written as introductions, for young people, to all that
I have said on the same matters in my larger books; and, on re-reading them, they satisfy me
better, and seem to me calculated to be more generally useful, than anything else I have done
of the kind.

The summary of the contents of the whole book, beginning, "You may at least earnestly believe,"
at p. 130, is thus the clearest exposition I have ever yet given of the general conditions
under which the Personal Creative Power manifests itself in the forms of matter; and the analysis
of heathen conceptions of Deity, beginning at p. 131, and closing at p. 138, not only prefaces,
but very nearly supersedes, all that in more lengthy terms I have since asserted, or pleaded
for, in 'Aratra Pentelici,' and the 'Queen of the Air.'

And thus, however the book may fail in its intention of suggesting new occupations or interests
to its younger readers, I think it worth reprinting, in the way I have also reprinted 'Unto
this Last,'--page for page; that the students of my more advanced works may be able to refer
to these as the original documents of them; of which the most essential in this book are these
following.

I. The explanation of the baseness of the avaricious functions of the Lower Pthah, p. 39, with
his beetle-gospel, p. 41, "that a nation can stand on its vices better than on its virtues,"
explains the main motive of all my books on Political Economy.

II. The examination of the connexion between stupidity and crime, pp. 57-62, anticipated all
that I have had to urge in Fors Clavigera against the commonly alleged excuse for public wickedness,--"They
don't mean it--they don't know any better."

III. The examination of the roots of Moral Power, pp. 90-92, is a summary of what is afterwards
developed with utmost care in my inaugural lecture at Oxford on the relation of Art to Morals;
compare in that lecture, §§ 83-85, with the sentence in p. 91 of this book, "Nothing is ever
done so as really to please our Father, unless we would also have done it, though we had had
no Father to know of it."

This sentence, however, it must be observed, regards only the general conditions of action
in the children of God, in consequence of which it is foretold of them by Christ that they
will say at the Judgment, "When saw we thee?" It does not refer to the distinct cases in which
virtue consists in faith given to command, appearing to foolish human judgment inconsistent
with the Moral Law, as in the sacrifice of Isaac; nor to those in which any directly-given
command requires nothing more of virtue than obedience.

IV. The subsequent pages, 92-97, were written especially to check the dangerous impulses natural
to the minds of many amiable young women, in the direction of narrow and selfish religious
sentiment: and they contain, therefore, nearly everything which I believe it necessary that
young people should be made to observe, respecting the errors of monastic life. But they in
nowise enter on the reverse, or favourable side: of which indeed I did not, and as yet do not,
feel myself able to speak with any decisiveness; the evidence on that side, as stated in the
text, having "never yet been dispassionately examined."

V. The dialogue with Lucilla, beginning at p. 63, is, to my own fancy, the best bit of conversation
in the book, and the issue of it, at p. 67, the most practically and immediately useful. For
on the idea of the inevitable weakness and corruption of human nature, has logically followed,
in our daily life, the horrible creed of modern "Social science," that all social action must
be scientifically founded on vicious impulses. But on the habit of measuring and reverencing
our powers and talents that we may kindly use them, will be founded a true Social science,
developing, by the employment of them, all the real powers and honourable feelings of the race.

VI. Finally, the account given in the second and third lectures, of the real nature and marvellousness
of the laws of crystallization, is necessary to the understanding of what farther teaching
of the beauty of inorganic form I may be able to give, either in 'Deucalion,' or in my 'Elements
of Drawing.' I wish however that the second lecture had been made the beginning of the book;
and would fain now cancel the first altogether, which I perceive to be both obscure and dull.
It was meant for a metaphorical description of the pleasures and dangers in the kingdom of
Mammon, or of worldly wealth; its waters mixed with blood, its fruits entangled in thickets
of trouble, and poisonous when gathered; and the final captivity of its inhabitants within
frozen walls of cruelty and disdain. But the imagery is stupid and ineffective throughout;
and I retain this chapter only because I am resolved to leave no room for any one to say that
I have withdrawn, as erroneous in principle, so much as a single sentence of any of my books
written since 1860.

One license taken in this book, however, though often permitted to essay-writers for the relief
of their dulness, I never mean to take more,--the relation of composed metaphor as of actual
dream, pp. 23 and 104. I assumed, it is true, that in these places the supposed dream would
be easily seen to be an invention; but must not any more, even under so transparent disguise,
pretend to any share in the real powers of Vision possessed by great poets and true painters.

PREFACE.

The following lectures were really given, in substance, at a girls' school (far in the country);
which in the course of various experiments on the possibility of introducing some better practice
of drawing into the modern scheme of female education, I visited frequently enough to enable
the children to regard me as a friend. The lectures always fell more or less into the form
of fragmentary answers to questions; and they are allowed to retain that form, as, on the whole,
likely to be more interesting than the symmetries of a continuous treatise. Many children (for
the school was large) took part, at different times, in the conversations; but I have endeavoured,
without confusedly multiplying the number of imaginary[144] speakers, to represent, as far
as I could, the general tone of comment and enquiry among young people.

It will be at once seen that these Lectures were not intended for an introduction to mineralogy.
Their purpose was merely to awaken in the minds of young girls, who were ready to work earnestly
and systematically, a vital interest in the subject of their study. No science can be learned
in play; but it is often possible, in play, to bring good fruit out of past labour, or show
sufficient reasons for the labour of the future.

The narrowness of this aim does not, indeed, justify the absence of all reference to many important
principles of structure, and many of the most interesting orders of minerals; but I felt it
impossible to go far into detail without illustrations; and if readers find this book useful,
I may, perhaps, endeavour to supplement it by illustrated notes of the more interesting phenomena
in separate groups of familiar minerals;--flints of the chalk;--agates of the basalts;--and
the fantastic and exquisitely beautiful varieties of the vein-ores of the two commonest metals,
lead and iron. But I have always found that the less we speak of our intentions, the more chance
there is of our realizing them; and this poor little book will sufficiently have done its work,
for the present, if it engages any of its young readers in study which may enable them to despise
it for its shortcomings.

FOOTNOTES:

[144] I do not mean, in saying 'imaginary,' that I have not permitted to myself, in several
instances, the affectionate discourtesy of some reminiscence of personal character; for which
I must hope to be forgiven by my old pupils and their friends, as I could not otherwise have
written the book at all. But only two sentences in all the dialogues, and the anecdote of 'Dotty,'
are literally 'historical.'

THE ETHICS OF THE DUST.

LECTURE I.

THE VALLEY OF DIAMONDS.

     A very idle talk, by the dining-room fire, after
     raisin-and-almond time.

OLD LECTURER; FLORRIE, ISABEL, MAY, LILY, and SIBYL.

OLD LECTURER (L.). Come here, Isabel, and tell me what the make-believe was, this afternoon.

ISABEL (arranging herself very primly on the foot-stool). Such a dreadful one! Florrie and
I were lost in the Valley of Diamonds.

L. What! Sindbad's, which nobody could get out of?

ISABEL. Yes; but Florrie and I got out of it.

L. So I see. At least, I see you did; but are you sure Florrie did?

ISABEL. Quite sure.

FLORRIE (putting her head round from behind L.'s sofa-cushion). Quite sure. (Disappears again.)

L. I think I could be made to feel surer about it.

     (FLORRIE reappears, gives L. a kiss, and again exit.)

L. I suppose it's all right; but how did you manage it?

ISABEL. Well, you know, the eagle that took up Sindbad was very large--very, very large--the
largest of all the eagles.

L. How large were the others?

ISABEL. I don't quite know--they were so far off. But this one was, oh, so big! and it had
great wings, as wide as--twice over the ceiling. So, when it was picking up Sindbad, Florrie
and I thought it wouldn't know if we got on its back too: so I got up first, and then I pulled
up Florrie, and we put our arms round its neck, and away it flew.

L. But why did you want to get out of the valley? and why haven't you brought me some diamonds?

ISABEL. It was because of the serpents. I couldn't pick up even the least little bit of a diamond,
I was so frightened.

L. You should not have minded the serpents.

ISABEL. Oh, but suppose that they had minded me?

L. We all of us mind you a little too much, Isabel, I'm afraid.

ISABEL. No--no--no, indeed.

L. I tell you what, Isabel--I don't believe either Sindbad, or Florrie, or you, ever were in
the Valley of Diamonds.

ISABEL. You naughty! when I tell you we were!

L. Because you say you were frightened at the serpents.

ISABEL. And wouldn't you have been?

L. Not at those serpents. Nobody who really goes into the valley is ever frightened at them--they
are so beautiful.

ISABEL (suddenly serious). But there's no real Valley of Diamonds, is there?

L. Yes, Isabel; very real indeed.

FLORRIE (reappearing). Oh, where? Tell me about it.

L. I cannot tell you a great deal about it; only I know it is very different from Sindbad's.
In his valley, there was only a diamond lying here and there; but, in the real valley, there
are diamonds covering the grass in showers every morning, instead of dew: and there are clusters
of trees, which look like lilac trees; but, in spring, all their blossoms are of amethyst.

FLORRIE. But there can't be any serpents there, then?

L. Why not?

FLORRIE. Because they don't come into such beautiful places.

L. I never said it was a beautiful place.

FLORRIE. What! not with diamonds strewed about it like dew?

L. That's according te your fancy, Florrie. For myself, I like dew better.

ISABEL. Oh, but the dew won't stay; it all dries!

L. Yes; and it would be much nicer if the diamonds dried too, for the people in the valley
have to sweep them off the grass, in heaps, whenever they want to walk on it; and then the
heaps glitter so, they hurt one's eyes.

FLORRIE. Now you're just playing, you know.

L. So are you, you know.

FLORRIE. Yes, but you mustn't play.

L. That's very hard, Florrie; why mustn't I, if you may?

FLORRIE. Oh, I may, because I'm little, but you mustn't, because you're--(hesitates for a delicate
expression of magnitude).

L. (rudely taking the first that comes). Because I'm big? No; that's not the way of it at all,
Florrie. Because you're little, you should have very little play; and because I'm big I should
have a great deal.

ISABEL and FLORRIE (both). No--no--no--no. That isn't it at all. (ISABEL sola, quoting Miss
Ingelow.) 'The lambs play always--they know no better.' (Putting her head very much on one
side.) Ah, now--please--please--tell us true; we want to know.

L. But why do you want me to tell you true, any more than the man who wrote the 'Arabian Nights?'

ISABEL. Because--because we like to know about real things; and you can tell us, and we can't
ask the man who wrote the stories.

L. What do you call real things?

ISABEL. Now, you know! Things that really are.

L. Whether you can see them or not?

ISABEL. Yes, if somebody else saw them.

L. But if nobody has ever seen them?

ISABEL (evading the point.) Well, but, you know, if there were a real Valley of Diamonds, somebody
must have seen it.

L. You cannot be so sure of that, Isabel. Many people go to real places, and never see them;
and many people pass through this valley, and never see it.

FLORRIE. What stupid people they must be!

L. No, Florrie. They are much wiser than the people who do see it.

MAY. I think I know where it is.

ISABEL. Tell us more about it, and then we'll guess.

L. Well. There's a great broad road, by a river-side, leading up into it.

MAY (gravely cunning, with emphasis on the last word). Does the road really go up?

L. You think it should go down into a valley? No, it goes up; this is a valley among the hills,
and it is as high as the clouds, and is often full of them; so that even the people who most
want to see it, cannot, always.

ISABEL. And what is the river beside the road like?

L. It ought to be very beautiful, because it flows over diamond sand--only the water is thick
and red.

ISABEL. Red water?

L. It isn't all water.

MAY. Oh, please never mind that, Isabel, just now; I want to hear about the valley.

L. So the entrance to it is very wide, under a steep rock; only such numbers of people are
always trying to get in, that they keep jostling each other, and manage it but slowly. Some
weak ones are pushed back, and never get in at all; and make great moaning as they go away:
but perhaps they are none the worse in the end.

MAY. And when one gets in, what is it like?

L. It is up and down, broken kind of ground: the road stops directly; and there are great dark
rocks, covered all over with wild gourds and wild vines; the gourds, if you cut them, are red,
with black seeds, like water-melons, and look ever so nice; and the people of the place make
a red pottage of them: but you must take care not to eat any if you ever want to leave the
valley (though I believe putting plenty of meal in it makes it wholesome). Then the wild vines
have clusters of the colour of amber; and the people of the country say they are the grape
of Eshcol; and sweeter than honey; but, indeed, if anybody else tastes them, they are like
gall. Then there are thickets of bramble, so thorny that they would be cut away directly, anywhere
else; but here they are covered with little cinque-foiled blossoms of pure silver; and, for
berries, they have clusters of rubies. Dark rubies, which you only see are red after gathering
them. But you may fancy what blackberry parties the children have! Only they get their frocks
and hands sadly torn.

LILY. But rubies can't spot one's frocks as blackberries do?

L. No; but I'll tell you what spots them--the mulberries. There are great forests of them,
all up the hills, covered with silkworms, some munching the leaves so loud that it is like
mills at work; and some spinning. But the berries are the blackest you ever saw; and, wherever
they fall, they stain a deep red; and nothing ever washes it out again. And it is their juice,
soaking through the grass, which makes the river so red, because all its springs are in this
wood. And the boughs of the trees are twisted, as if in pain, like old olive branches; and
their leaves are dark. And it is in these forests that the serpents are; but nobody is afraid
of them. They have fine crimson crests, and they are wreathed about the wild branches, one
in every tree, nearly; and they are singing serpents, for the serpents are, in this forest,
what birds are in ours.

FLORRIE. Oh, I don't want to go there at all, now.

L. You would like it very much indeed, Florrie, if you were there. The serpents would not bite
you; the only fear would be of your turning into one!

FLORRIE. Oh, dear, but that's worse.

L. You wouldn't think so if you really were turned into one, Florrie; you would be very proud
of your crest. And as long as you were yourself (not that you could get there if you remained
quite the little Florrie you are now), you would like to hear the serpents sing. They hiss
a little through it, like the cicadas in Italy; but they keep good time, and sing delightful
melodies; and most of them have seven heads, with throats which each take a note of the octave;
so that they can sing chords--it is very fine indeed. And the fire-flies fly round the edge
of the forests all the night long; you wade in fire-flies, they make the fields look like a
lake trembling with reflection of stars; but you must take care not to touch them, for they
are not like Italian fireflies, but burn, like real sparks.

FLORRIE. I don't like it at all; I'll never go there.

L. I hope not, Florrie; or at least that you will get out again if you do. And it is very difficult
to get out, for beyond these serpent forests there are great cliffs of dead gold, which form
a labyrinth, winding always higher and higher, till the gold is all split asunder by wedges
of ice; and glaciers, welded, half of ice seven times frozen, and half of gold seven times
frozen, hang down from them, and fall in thunder, cleaving into deadly splinters, like the
Cretan arrowheads; and into a mixed dust of snow and gold, ponderous, yet which the mountain
whirlwinds are able to lift and drive in wreaths and pillars, hiding the paths with a burial
cloud, fatal at once with wintry chill, and weight of golden ashes. So the wanderers in the
labyrinth fall, one by one, and are buried there:--yet, over the drifted graves, those who
are spared climb to the last, through coil on coil of the path;--for at the end of it they
see the king of the valley, sitting on his throne: and beside him (but it is only a false vision),
spectra of creatures like themselves, set on thrones, from which they seem to look down on
all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them. And on the canopy of his throne there
is an inscription in fiery letters, which they strive to read, but cannot; for it is written
in words which are like the words of all languages, and yet are of none. Men say it is more
like their own tongue to the English than it is to any other nation; but the only record of
it is by an Italian, who heard the King himself cry it as a war cry, 'Pape Satan, Pape Satan
Aleppe.'[145]

SIBYL. But do they all perish there? You said there was a way through the valley, and out of it.

L. Yes; but few find it. If any of them keep to the grass paths, where the diamonds are swept
aside; and hold their hands over their eyes so as not to be dazzled, the grass paths lead forward
gradually to a place where one sees a little opening in the golden rocks. You were at Chamouni
last year, Sibyl; did your guide chance to show you the pierced rock of the Aiguille du Midi?

SIBYL. No, indeed, we only got up from Geneva on Monday night; and it rained all Tuesday; and
we had to be back at Geneva again, early on Wednesday morning.

L. Of course. That is the way to see a country in a Sibylline manner, by inner consciousness:
but you might have seen the pierced rock in your drive up, or down, if the clouds broke: not
that there is much to see in it; one of the crags of the aiguille-edge, on the southern slope
of it, is struck sharply through, as by an awl, into a little eyelet hole; which you may see,
seven thousand feet above the valley (as the clouds flit past behind it, or leave the sky),
first white, and then dark blue. Well, there's just such an eyelet hole in one of the upper
crags of the Diamond Valley; and, from a distance, you think that it is no bigger than the
eye of a needle. But if you get up to it, they say you may drive a loaded camel through it,
and that there are fine things on the other side, but I have never spoken with anybody who
had been through.

SIBYL. I think we understand it now. We will try to write it down, and think of it.

L. Meantime, Florrie, though all that I have been telling you is very true, yet you must not
think the sort of diamonds that people wear in rings and necklaces are found lying about on
the grass. Would you like to see how they really are found?

FLORRIE. Oh, yes--yes.

L. Isabel--or Lily--run up to my room and fetch me the little box with a glass lid, out of
the top drawer of the chest of drawers. (Race between LILY and ISABEL.)

     (Re-enter ISABEL with the box, very much out of breath.
     LILY behind.)

L. Why, you never can beat Lily in a race on the stairs, can you, Isabel?

ISABEL (panting). Lily--beat me--ever so far--but she gave me--the box--to carry in.

L. Take off the lid, then; gently.

FLORRIE (after peeping in, disappointed). There's only a great ugly brown stone!

L. Not much more than that, certainly, Florrie, if people were wise. But look, it is not a
single stone; but a knot of pebbles fastened together by gravel; and in the gravel, or compressed
sand, if you look close, you will see grains of gold glittering everywhere, all through; and
then, do you see these two white beads, which shine, as if they had been covered with grease?

FLORRIE. May I touch them?

L. Yes; you will find they are not greasy, only very smooth. Well, those are the fatal jewels;
native here in their dust with gold, so that you may see, cradled here together, the two great
enemies of mankind,--the strongest of all malignant physical powers that have tormented our race.

SIBYL. Is that really so? I know they do great harm; but do they not also do great good?

L. My dear child, what good? Was any woman, do you suppose, ever the better for possessing
diamonds? but how many have been made base, frivolous, and miserable by desiring them? Was
ever man the better for having coffers full of gold? But who shall measure the guilt that is
incurred to fill them? Look into the history of any civilised nations; analyse, with reference
to this one cause of crime and misery, the lives and thoughts of their nobles, priests, merchants,
and men of luxurious life. Every other temptation is at last concentrated into this; pride,
and lust, and envy, and anger all give up their strength to avarice. The sin of the whole world
is essentially the sin of Judas. Men do not disbelieve their Christ; but they sell Him.

SIBYL. But surely that is the fault of human nature? it is not caused by the accident, as it
were, of there being a pretty metal, like gold, to be found by digging. If people could not
find that, would they not find something else, and quarrel for it instead?

L. No. Wherever legislators have succeeded in excluding, for a time, jewels and precious metals
from among national possessions, the national spirit has remained healthy. Covetousness is
not natural to man--generosity is; but covetousness must be excited by a special cause, as
a given disease by a given miasma; and the essential nature of a material for the excitement
of covetousness is, that it shall be a beautiful thing which can be retained without a use.
The moment we can use our possessions to any good purpose ourselves, the instinct of communicating
that use to others rises side by side with our power. If you can read a book rightly, you will
want others to hear it; if you can enjoy a picture rightly, you will want others to see it:
learn how to manage a horse, a plough, or a ship, and you will desire to make your subordinates
good horsemen, ploughmen, or sailors; you will never be able to see the fine instrument you
are master of, abused; but, once fix your desire on anything useless, and all the purest pride
and folly in your heart will mix with the desire, and make you at last wholly inhuman, a mere
ugly lump of stomach and suckers, like a cuttle-fish.

SIBYL. But surely, these two beautiful things, gold and diamonds, must have been appointed
to some good purpose?

L. Quite conceivably so, my dear: as also earthquakes and pestilences; but of such ultimate
purposes we can have no sight. The practical, immediate office of the earthquake and pestilence
is to slay us, like moths; and, as moths, we shall be wise to live out of their way. So, the
practical, immediate office of gold and diamonds is the multiplied destruction of souls (in
whatever sense you have been taught to understand that phrase); and the paralysis of wholesome
human effort and thought on the face of God's earth: and a wise nation will live out of the
way of them. The money which the English habitually spend in cutting diamonds would, in ten
years, if it were applied to cutting rocks instead, leave no dangerous reef nor difficult harbour
round the whole island coast. Great Britain would be a diamond worth cutting, indeed, a true
piece of regalia. (Leaves this to their thoughts for a little while.) Then, also, we poor mineralogists
might sometimes have the chance of seeing a fine crystal of diamond unhacked by the jeweller.

SIBYL. Would it be more beautiful uncut?

L. No; but of infinite interest. We might even come to know something about the making of diamonds.

SIBYL. I thought the chemists could make them already?

L. In very small black crystals, yes; but no one knows how they are formed where they are found;
or if indeed they are formed there at all. These, in my hand, look as if they had been swept
down with the gravel and gold; only we can trace the gravel and gold to their native rocks,
but not the diamonds. Read the account given of the diamond in any good work on mineralogy;--you
will find nothing but lists of localities of gravel, or conglomerate rock (which is only an
old indurated gravel). Some say it was once a vegetable gum; but it may have been charred wood;
but what one would like to know is, mainly, why charcoal should make itself into diamonds in
India, and only into black lead in Borrowdale.

SIBYL. Are they wholly the same, then?

L. There is a little iron mixed with our black lead but nothing to hinder its crystallisation.
Your pencils in fact are all pointed with formless diamond, though they would be HHH pencils
to purpose, if it crystallised.

SUBYL. But what is crystallisation?

L. A pleasant question, when one's half asleep, and it has been tea time these two hours. What
thoughtless things girls are!

SIBYL. Yes, we are; but we want to know, for all that.

L. My dear, it would take a week to tell you.

SIBYL. Well, take it, and tell us.

L. But nobody knows anything about it.

SIBYL. Then tell us something that nobody knows.

L. Get along with you, and tell Dora to make tea.

     (The house rises; but of course the LECTURER wanted to be
     forced to lecture again, and was.)

[145] Dante, Inf. 7. 1.

LECTURE II.

THE PYRAMID BUILDERS.

     In the large Schoolroom, to which everybody has been
     summoned by ringing of the great bell.

L. So you have all actually come to hear about crystallisation! I cannot conceive why, unless
the little ones think that the discussion may involve some reference to sugar-candy.

     (Symptoms of high displeasure among the younger members of
     council. ISABEL frowns severely at L., and shakes her head
     violently.)

My dear children, if you knew it, you are yourselves, at this moment, as you sit in your ranks,
nothing, in the eye of a mineralogist, but a lovely group of rosy sugar-candy, arranged by
atomic forces. And even admitting you to be something more, you have certainly been crystallising
without knowing it. Did I not hear a great hurrying and whispering, ten minutes ago, when you
were late in from the playground; and thought you would not all be quietly seated by the time
I was ready:--besides some discussion about places--something about 'it's not being fair that
the little ones should always be nearest?' Well, you were then all being crystallised. When
you ran in from the garden, and against one another in the passages, you were in what mineralogists
would call a state of solution, and gradual confluence; when you got seated in those orderly
rows, each in her proper place, you became crystalline. That is just what the atoms of a mineral
do, if they can, whenever they get disordered: they get into order again as soon as may be.

I hope you feel inclined to interrupt me, and say, 'But we know our places; how do the atoms
know theirs? And sometimes we dispute about our places; do the atoms--(and, besides, we don't
like being compared to atoms at all)--never dispute about theirs?' Two wise questions these,
if you had a mind to put them! it was long before I asked them myself, of myself. And I will
not call you atoms any more. May I call you--let me see--'primary molecules?' (General dissent,
indicated in subdued but decisive murmurs.) No! not even, in familiar Saxon, 'dust?'

     (Pause, with expression on faces of sorrowful doubt; LILY
     gives voice to the general sentiment in a timid 'Please
     don't.')

No, children, I won't call you that; and mind, as you grow up, that you do not get into an
idle and wicked habit of calling yourselves that. You are something better than dust, and have
other duties to do than ever dust can do; and the bonds of affection you will enter into are
better than merely 'getting into order.' But see to it, on the other hand, that you always
behave at least as well as 'dust;' remember, it is only on compulsion, and while it has no
free permission to do as it likes, that it ever gets out of order; but sometimes, with some
of us, the compulsion has to be the other way--hasn't it? (Remonstratory whispers, expressive
of opinion that the LECTURER is becoming too personal.) I'm not looking at anybody in particular--indeed
I am not. Nay, if you blush so, Kathleen, how can one help looking? We'll go back to the atoms.

'How do they know their places?' you asked, or should have asked. Yes, and they have to do
much more than know them: they have to find their way to them, and that quietly and at once,
without running against each other.

We may, indeed, state it briefly thus:--Suppose you have to build a castle, with towers and
roofs and buttresses, out of bricks of a given shape, and that these bricks are all lying in
a huge heap at the bottom, in utter confusion, upset out of carts at random. You would have
to draw a great many plans, and count all your bricks, and be sure you had enough for this
and that tower, before you began, and then you would have to lay your foundation, and add layer
by layer, in order, slowly.

But how would you be astonished, in these melancholy days, when children don't read children's
books, nor believe any more in fairies, if suddenly a real benevolent fairy, in a bright brick-red
gown, were to rise in the midst of the red bricks, and to tap the heap of them with her wand,
and say: 'Bricks, bricks, to your places!' and then you saw in an instant the whole heap rise
in the air, like a swarm of red bees, and--you have been used to see bees make a honeycomb,
and to think that strange enough, but now you would see the honeycomb make itself!--You want
to ask something, Florrie, by the look of your eyes.

FLORRIE. Are they turned into real bees, with stings?

L. No, Florrie; you are only to fancy flying bricks, as you saw the slates flying from the
roof the other day in the storm; only those slates didn't seem to know where they were going,
and, besides, were going where they had no business: but my spell-bound bricks, though they
have no wings, and what is worse, no heads and no eyes, yet find their way in the air just
where they should settle, into towers and roofs, each flying to his place and fastening there
at the right moment, so that every other one shall fit to him in his turn.

LILY. But who are the fairies, then, who build the crystals?

L. There is one great fairy, Lily, who builds much more than crystals; but she builds these
also. I dreamed that I saw her building a pyramid, the other day, as she used to do, for the
Pharaohs.

ISABEL. But that was only a dream?

L. Some dreams are truer than some wakings, Isabel; but I won't tell it you unless you like.

ISABEL. Oh, please, please.

L. You are all such wise children, there's no talking to you; you won't believe anything.

LILY. No, we are not wise, and we will believe anything, when you say we ought.

L. Well, it came about this way. Sibyl, do you recollect that evening when we had been looking
at your old cave by Cumæ, and wondering why you didn't live there still; and then we wondered
how old you were; and Egypt said you wouldn't tell, and nobody else could tell but she; and
you laughed--I thought very gaily for a Sibyl--and said you would harness a flock of cranes
for us, and we might fly over to Egypt if we liked, and see.

SIBYL. Yes, and you went, and couldn't find out after all!

L. Why, you know, Egypt had been just doubling that third pyramid of hers;[146] and making
a new entrance into it; and a fine entrance it was! First, we had to go through an ante-room,
which had both its doors blocked up with stones; and then we had three granite portcullises
to pull up, one after another; and the moment we had got under them, Egypt signed to somebody
above; and down they came again behind us, with a roar like thunder, only louder; then we got
into a passage fit for nobody but rats, and Egypt wouldn't go any further herself, but said
we might go on if we liked; and so we came to a hole in the pavement, and then to a granite
trap-door--and then we thought we had gone quite far enough, and came back, and Egypt laughed
at us.

EGYPT. You would not have had me take my crown off, and stoop all the way down a passage fit
only for rats?

L. It was not the crown, Egypt--you know that very well. It was the flounces that would not
let you go any farther. I suppose, however, you wear them as typical of the inundation of the
Nile, so it is all right.

ISABEL. Why didn't you take me with you? Where rats can go, mice can. I wouldn't have come back.

L. No, mousie; you would have gone on by yourself, and you might have waked one of Pasht's
cats.[147] and it would have eaten you. I was very glad you were not there. But after all this,
I suppose the imagination of the heavy granite blocks and the underground ways had troubled
me, and dreams are often shaped in a strange opposition to the impressions that have caused
them; and from all that we had been reading in Bunsen about stones that couldn't be lifted
with levers, I began to dream about stones that lifted themselves with wings.

SIBYL. Now you must just tell us all about it.

L. I dreamed that I was standing beside the lake, out of whose clay the bricks were made for
the great pyramid of Asychis.[148] They had just been all finished, and were lying by the lake
margin, in long ridges, like waves. It was near evening; and as I looked towards the sunset,
I saw a thing like a dark pillar standing where the rock of the desert stoops to the Nile valley.
I did not know there was a pillar there, and wondered at it; and it grew larger, and glided
nearer, becoming like the form of a man, but vast, and it did not move its feet, but glided
like a pillar of sand. And as it drew nearer, I looked by chance past it, towards the sun;
and saw a silver cloud, which was of all the clouds closest to the sun (and in one place crossed
it), draw itself back from the sun, suddenly. And it turned, and shot towards the dark pillar;
leaping in an arch, like an arrow out of a bow. And I thought it was lightning; but when it
came near the shadowy pillar, it sank slowly down beside it, and changed into the shape of
a woman, very beautiful, and with a strength of deep calm in her blue eyes. She was robed to
the feet with a white robe; and above that, to her knees, by the cloud which I had seen across
the sun; but all the golden ripples of it had become plumes, so that it had changed into two
bright wings like those of a vulture, which wrapped round her to her knees. She had a weaver's
shuttle hanging over her shoulder, by the thread of it, and in her left hand, arrows, tipped
with fire.

ISABEL (clapping her hands). Oh! it was Neith, it was Neith! I know now.

L. Yes; it was Neith herself; and as the two great spirits came nearer to me, I saw they were
the Brother and Sister--the pillared shadow was the Greater Pthah.[149] And I heard them speak,
and the sound of their words was like a distant singing. I could not understand the words one
by one; yet their sense came to me; and so I knew that Neith had come down to see her brother's
work, and the work that he had put into the mind of the king to make his servants do. And she
was displeased at it; because she saw only pieces of dark clay: and no porphyry, nor marble,
nor any fair stone that men might engrave the figures of the gods upon. And she blamed her
brother, and said, 'Oh, Lord of truth! is this then thy will, that men should mould only four-square
pieces of clay: and the forms of the gods no more?' Then the Lord of truth sighed, and said,
'Oh! sister, in truth they do not love us; why should they set up our images? Let them do what
they may, and not lie--let them make their clay four-square; and labour; and perish.'

Then Neith's dark blue eyes grew darker, and she said, 'Oh, Lord of truth! why should they
love us? their love is vain; or fear us? for their fear is base. Yet let them testify of us,
that they knew we lived for ever.'

But the Lord of truth answered, 'They know, and yet they know not. Let them keep silence; for
their silence only is truth.'

But Neith answered, 'Brother, wilt thou also make league with Death, because Death is true?
Oh! thou potter, who hast cast these human things from thy wheel, many to dishonour, and few
to honour; wilt thou not let them so much as see my face; but slay them in slavery?'

But Pthah only answered, 'Let them build, sister, let them build.'

And Neith answered, 'What shall they build, if I build not with them?'

And Pthah drew with his measuring rod upon the sand. And I saw suddenly, drawn on the sand,
the outlines of great cities, and of vaults, and domes, and aqueducts, and bastions, and towers,
greater than obelisks, covered with black clouds. And the wind blew ripples of sand amidst
the lines that Pthah drew, and the moving sand was like the marching of men. But I saw that
wherever Neith looked at the lines, they faded, and were effaced.

'Oh, Brother!' she said at last, 'what is this vanity? If I, who am Lady of wisdom, do not
mock the children of men, why shouldst thou mock them, who art Lord of truth?' But Pthah answered,
'They thought to bind me; and they shall be bound. They shall labour in the fire for vanity.'

And Neith said, looking at the sand, 'Brother, there is no true labour here--there is only
weary life and wasteful death.'

And Pthah answered, 'Is it not truer labour, sister, than thy sculpture of dreams?'

Then Neith smiled; and stopped suddenly.

She looked to the sun; its edge touched the horizon-edge of the desert. Then she looked to
the long heaps of pieces of clay, that lay, each with its blue shadow, by the lake shore.

'Brother,' she said, 'how long will this pyramid of thine be in building?'

'Thoth will have sealed the scroll of the years ten times, before the summit is laid.'

'Brother, thou knowest not how to teach thy children to labour,' answered Neith. 'Look! I must
follow Phre beyond Atlas; shall I build your pyramid for you before he goes down?' And Pthah
answered, 'Yea, sister, if thou canst put thy winged shoulders to such work.' And Neith drew
herself to her height; and I heard a clashing pass through the plumes of her wings, and the
asp stood up on her helmet, and fire gathered in her eyes. And she took one of the flaming
arrows out of the sheaf in her left hand, and stretched it out over the heaps of clay. And
they rose up like flights of locusts, and spread themselves in the air, so that it grew dark
in a moment. Then Neith designed them places with her arrow point; and they drew into ranks,
like dark clouds laid level at morning. Then Neith pointed with her arrow to the north, and
to the south, and to the east, and to the west, and the flying motes of earth drew asunder
into four great ranked crowds; and stood, one in the north, and one in the south, and one in
the east, and one in the west--one against another. Then Neith spread her wings wide for an
instant, and closed them with a sound like the sound of a rushing sea; and waved her hand towards
the foundation of the pyramid, where it was laid on the brow of the desert. And the four flocks
drew together and sank down, like sea-birds settling to a level rock; and when they met, there
was a sudden flame, as broad as the pyramid, and as high as the clouds; and it dazzled me;
and I closed my eyes for an instant; and when I looked again, the pyramid stood on its rock,
perfect; and purple with the light from the edge of the sinking sun.

THE YOUNGER CHILDREN (variously pleased). I'm so glad! How nice! But what did Pthah say?

L. Neith did not wait to hear what he would say. When I turned back to look at her, she was
gone; and I only saw the level white cloud form itself again, close to the arch of the sun
as it sank. And as the last edge of the sun disappeared, the form of Pthah faded into a mighty
shadow, and so passed away.

EGYPT. And was Neith's pyramid left?

L. Yes; but you could not think, Egypt, what a strange feeling of utter loneliness came over
me when the presence of the two gods passed away. It seemed as if I had never known what it
was to be alone before; and the unbroken line of the desert was terrible.

EGYPT. I used to feel that, when I was queen: sometimes I had to carve gods, for company, all
over my palace. I would fain have seen real ones, if I could.

L. But listen a moment yet, for that was not quite all my dream. The twilight drew swiftly
to the dark, and I could hardly see the great pyramid; when there came a heavy murmuring sound
in the air; and a horned beetle, with terrible claws, fell on the sand at my feet, with a blow
like the beat of a hammer. Then it stood up on its hind claws, and waved its pincers at me:
and its fore claws became strong arms, and hands; one grasping real iron pincers, and the other
a huge hammer; and it had a helmet on its head, without any eyelet holes, that I could see.
And its two hind claws became strong crooked legs, with feet bent inwards. And so there stood
by me a dwarf, in glossy black armour, ribbed and embossed like a beetle's back, leaning on
his hammer. And I could not speak for wonder; but he spoke with a murmur like the dying away
of a beat upon a bell. He said, 'I will make Neith's great pyramid small. I am the lower Pthah;
and have power over fire. I can wither the strong things, and strengthen the weak; and everything
that is great I can make small, and everything that is little I can make great.' Then he turned
to the angle of the pyramid and limped towards it. And the pyramid grew deep purple; and then
red like blood, and then pale rose-colour, like fire. And I saw that it glowed with fire from
within. And the lower Pthah touched it with the hand that held the pincers; and it sank down
like the sand in an hour-glass,--then drew itself together, and sank, still, and became nothing,
it seemed to me; but the armed dwarf stooped down, and took it into his hand, and brought it
to me, saying, 'Everything that is great I can make like this pyramid; and give into men's
hands to destroy.' And I saw that he had a little pyramid in his hand, with as many courses
in it as the large one; and built like that, only so small. And because it glowed still, I
was afraid to touch it; but Pthah said, 'Touch it--for I have bound the fire within it, so
that it cannot burn.' So I touched it, and took it into my own hand; and it was cold; only
red, like a ruby. And Pthah laughed, and became like a beetle again, and buried himself in
the sand, fiercely; throwing it back over his shoulders. And it seemed to me as if he would
draw me down with him into the sand; and I started back, and woke, holding the little pyramid
so fast in my hand that it hurt me.

EGYPT. Holding WHAT in your hand?

L. The little pyramid.

EGYPT. Neith's pyramid?

L. Neith's, I believe; though not built for Asychis. I know only that it is a little rosy transparent
pyramid, built of more courses of bricks than I can count, it being made so small. You don't
believe me, of course, Egyptian infidel; but there it is. (Giving crystal of rose Fluor.)

     (Confused examination by crowded audience, over each
     other's shoulders and under each other's arms.
     Disappointment begins to manifest itself.)

SIBYL (not quite knowing why she and others are disappointed). But you showed us this the other
day!

L. Yes; but you would not look at it the other day.

SIBYL. But was all that fine dream only about this?

L. What finer thing could a dream be about than this! It is small, if you will; but when you
begin to think of things rightly, the ideas of smallness and largeness pass away. The making
of this pyramid was in reality just as wonderful as the dream I have been telling you, and
just as incomprehensible. It was not, I suppose, as swift, but quite as grand things are done
as swiftly. When Neith makes crystals of snow, it needs a great deal more marshalling of the
atoms, by her flaming arrows, than it does to make crystals like this one; and that is done
in a moment.

EGYPT. But how you do puzzle us! Why do you say Neith does it? You don't mean that she is a
real spirit, do you?

L. What I mean, is of little consequence. What the Egyptians meant, who called her 'Neith,'--or
Homer, who called her 'Athena,'--or Solomon, who called her by a word which the Greeks render
as 'Sophia,' you must judge for yourselves. But her testimony is always the same, and all nations
have received it: 'I was by Him as one brought up with Him, and I was daily His delight; rejoicing
in the habitable parts of the earth, and my delights were with the sons of men.'

MARY. But is not that only a personification?

L. If it be, what will you gain by unpersonifying it, or what right have you to do so? Cannot
you accept the image given you, in its life; and listen, like children, to the words which
chiefly belong to you as children: 'I love them that love me, and those that seek me early
shall find me?'

     (They are all quiet for a minute or two; questions begin to
     appear in their eyes.)

I cannot talk to you any more to-day. Take that rose-crystal away with you and think.

LECTURE III.

THE CRYSTAL LIFE.

     A very dull Lecture, wilfully brought upon themselves by
     the elder children. Some of the young ones have, however,
     managed to get in by mistake. SCENE, the Schoolroom.

L. So I am to stand up here merely to be asked questions, to-day, Miss Mary, am I?

MARY. Yes; and you must answer them plainly; without telling us any more stories. You are quite
spoiling the children: the poor little things' heads are turning round like kaleidoscopes;
and they don't know in the least what you mean. Nor do we old ones, either, for that matter:
to-day you must really tell us nothing but facts.

L. I am sworn; but you won't like it, a bit.

MARY. Now, first of all, what do you mean by 'bricks?'--Are the smallest particles of minerals
all of some accurate shape, like bricks?

L. I do not know, Miss Mary; I do not even know if anybody knows. The smallest atoms which
are visibly and practically put together to make large crystals, may better be described as
'limited in fixed directions' than as 'of fixed forms.' But I can tell you nothing clear about
ultimate atoms: you will find the idea of little bricks, or, perhaps, of little spheres, available
for all the uses you will have to put it to.

MARY. Well, it's very provoking; one seems always to be stopped just when one is coming to
the very thing one wants to know.

L. No, Mary, for we should not wish to know anything but what is easily and assuredly knowable.
There's no end to it If I could show you, or myself, a group of ultimate atoms, quite clearly,
in this magnifying glass, we should both be presently vexed because we could not break them
in two pieces, and see their insides.

MARY. Well then, next, what do you mean by the flying of the bricks? What is it the atoms do,
that is like flying?

L. When they are dissolved, or uncrystallised, they are really separated from each other, like
a swarm of gnats in the air, or like a shoal of fish in the sea;--generally at about equal
distances. In currents of solutions, or at different depths of them, one part may be more full
of the dissolved atoms than another; but on the whole, you may think of them as equidistant,
like the spots in the print of your gown. If they are separated by force of heat only, the
substance is said to be melted; if they are separated by any other substance, as particles
of sugar by water, they are said to be 'dissolved.' Note this distinction carefully, all of you.

DORA. I will be very particular. When next you tell me there isn't sugar enough in your tea,
I will say, 'It is not yet dissolved, sir.'

L. I tell you what shall be dissolved, Miss Dora; and that's the present parliament, if the
members get too saucy.

     (DORA folds her hands and casts down her eyes.)

L. (proceeds in state). Now, Miss Mary, you know already, I believe, that nearly everything
will melt, under a sufficient heat, like wax. Limestone melts (under pressure); sand melts;
granite melts; the lava of a volcano is a mixed mass of many kinds of rocks, melted: and any
melted substance nearly always, if not always, crystallises as it cools; the more slowly the
more perfectly. Water melts at what we call the freezing, but might just as wisely, though
not as conveniently, call the melting, point; and radiates as it cools into the most beautiful
of all known crystals. Glass melts at a greater heat, and will crystallise, if you let it cool
slowly enough, in stars, much like snow. Gold needs more heat to melt it, but crystallises
also exquisitely, as I will presently show you. Arsenic and sulphur crystallise from their
vapours. Now in any of these cases, either of melted, dissolved, or vaporous bodies, the particles
are usually separated from each other, either by heat, or by an intermediate substance; and
in crystallising they are both brought nearer to each other, and packed, so as to fit as closely
as possible: the essential part of the business being not the bringing together, but the packing.
Who packed your trunk for you, last holidays, Isabel?

ISABEL. Lily does, always.

L. And how much can you allow for Lily's good packing, in guessing what will go into the trunk?

ISABEL. Oh! I bring twice as much as the trunk holds. Lily always gets everything in.

LILY. Ah! but, Isey, if you only knew what a time it takes! and since you've had those great
hard buttons on your frocks, I can't do anything with them. Buttons won't go anywhere, you know.

L. Yes, Lily, it would be well if she only knew what a time it takes; and I wish any of us
knew what a time crystallisation takes, for that is consummately fine packing. The particles
of the rock are thrown down, just as Isabel brings her things--in a heap; and innumerable Lilies,
not of the valley, but of the rock, come to pack them. But it takes such a time!

However, the best--out and out the best--way of understanding the thing, is to crystallise
yourselves.

THE AUDIENCE. Ourselves!

L. Yes; not merely as you did the other day, carelessly, on the schoolroom forms; but carefully
and finely, out in the playground. You can play at crystallisation there as much as you please.

KATHLEEN and JESSIE. Oh! how?--how?

L. First, you must put yourselves together, as close as you can, in the middle of the grass,
and form, for first practice any figure you like.

JESSIE. Any dancing figure, do you mean?

L. No; I mean a square, or a cross, or a diamond. Any figure you like, standing close together.
You had better outline it first on the turf, with sticks, or pebbles, so as to see that it
is rightly drawn; then get into it and enlarge or diminish it at one side, till you are all
quite in it, and no empty space left.

DORA. Crinoline and all?

L. The crinoline may stand eventually for rough crystalline surface, unless you pin it in;
and then you may make a polished crystal of yourselves.

LILY. Oh, we'll pin it in--we'll pin it in!

L. Then, when you are all in the figure, let every one note her place, and who is next her
on each side; and let the outsiders count how many places they stand from the corners.

KATHLEEN. Yes, yes,--and then?

L. Then you must scatter all over the playground--right over it from side to side, and end
to end; and put yourselves all at equal distances from each other, everywhere. You needn't
mind doing it very accurately, but so as to be nearly equidistant; not less than about three
yards apart from each other, on every side.

JESSIE. We can easily cut pieces of string of equal length, to hold. And then?

L. Then, at a given signal, let everybody walk, at the same rate, towards the outlined figure
in the middle. You had better sing as you walk; that will keep you in good time. And as you
close in towards it, let each take her place, and the next comers fit themselves in beside
the first ones, till you are all in the figure again.

KATHLEEN. Oh! how we shall run against each other! What fun it will be!

L. No, no, Miss Katie; I can't allow any running against each other. The atoms never do that,
whatever human creatures do. You must all know your places, and find your way to them without
jostling.

LILY. But how ever shall we do that?

ISABEL. Mustn't the ones in the middle be the nearest, and the outside ones farther off--when
we go away to scatter, I mean?

L. Yes; you must be very careful to keep your order; you will soon find out how to do it; it
is only like soldiers forming square, except that each must stand still in her place as she
reaches it, and the others come round her; and you will have much more complicated figures,
afterwards, to form, than squares.

ISABEL. I'll put a stone at my place: then I shall know it.

L. You might each nail a bit of paper to the turf, at your place, with your name upon it: but
it would be of no use, for if you don't know your places, you will make a fine piece of business
of it, while you are looking for your names. And, Isabel, if with a little head, and eyes,
and a brain (all of them very good and serviceable of their kind, as such things go), you think
you cannot know your place without a stone at it, after examining it well,--how do you think
each atom knows its place, when it never was there before, and there's no stone at it?

ISABEL. But does every atom know its place?

L. How else could it get there?

MARY. Are they not attracted to their places?

L. Cover a piece of paper with spots, at equal intervals; and then imagine any kind of attraction
you choose, or any law of attraction, to exist between the spots, and try how, on that permitted
supposition, you can attract them into the figure of a Maltese cross, in the middle of the paper.

MARY (having tried it). Yes; I see that I cannot:--one would need all kinds of attractions,
in different ways, at different places. But you do not mean that the atoms are alive?

L. What is it to be alive?

DORA. There now; you're going to be provoking, I know.

L. I do not see why it should be provoking to be asked what it is to be alive. Do you think
you don't know whether you are alive or not?

     (ISABEL skips to the end of the room and back.)

L. Yes, Isabel, that's all very fine; and you and I may call that being alive: but a modern
philosopher calls it being in a 'mode of motion.' It requires a certain quantity of heat to
take you to the sideboard; and exactly the same quantity to bring you back again. That's all.

ISABEL. No, it isn't. And besides, I'm not hot.

L. I am, sometimes, at the way they talk. However, you know, Isabel, you might have been a
particle of a mineral, and yet have been carried round the room, or anywhere else, by chemical
forces, in the liveliest way.

ISABEL. Yes; but I wasn't carried: I carried myself.

L. The fact is, mousie, the difficulty is not so much to say what makes a thing alive, as what
makes it a Self. As soon as you are shut off from the rest of the universe into a Self, you
begin to be alive.

VIOLET (indignant). Oh, surely--surely that cannot be so. Is not all the life of the soul in
communion, not separation?

L. There can be no communion where there is no distinction. But we shall be in an abyss of
metaphysics presently, if we don't look out; and besides, we must not be too grand, to-day,
for the younger children. We'll be grand, some day, by ourselves, if we must. (The younger
children are not pleased, and prepare to remonstrate; but, knowing by experience, that all
conversations in which the word 'communion' occurs, are unintelligible, think better of it.)
Meantime, for broad answer about the atoms. I do not think we should use the word 'life,' of
any energy which does not belong to a given form. A seed, or an egg, or a young animal are
properly called 'alive' with respect to the force belonging to those forms, which consistently
develops that form, and no other. But the force which crystallises a mineral appears to be
chiefly external, and it does not produce an entirely determinate and individual form, limited
in size, but only an aggregation, in which some limiting laws must be observed.

MARY. But I do not see much difference, that way, between a crystal and a tree.

L. Add, then, that the mode of the energy in a living thing implies a continual change in its
elements; and a period for its end. So you may define life by its attached negative, death;
and still more by its attached positive, birth. But I won't be plagued any more about this,
just now; if you choose to think the crystals alive, do, and welcome. Rocks have always been
called 'living' in their native place.

MARY. There's one question more; then I've done.

L. Only one?

MARY. Only one.

L. But if it is answered, won't it turn into two?

MARY. No; I think it will remain single, and be comfortable.

L. Let me hear it.

MARY. You know, we are to crystallise ourselves out of the whole playground. Now, what playground
have the minerals? Where are they scattered before they are crystallised; and where are the
crystals generally made?

L. That sounds to me more like three questions than one, Mary. If it is only one, it is a wide one.

MARY. I did not say anything about the width of it.

L. Well, I must keep it within the best compass I can. When rocks either dry from a moist state,
or cool from a heated state, they necessarily alter in bulk; and cracks, or open spaces, form
in them in all directions. These cracks must be filled up with solid matter, or the rock would
eventually become a ruinous heap. So, sometimes by water, sometimes by vapour, sometimes nobody
knows how, crystallisable matter is brought from somewhere, and fastens itself in these open
spaces, so as to bind the rock together again, with crystal cement. A vast quantity of hollows
are formed in lavas by bubbles of gas, just as the holes are left in bread well baked. In process
of time these cavities are generally filled with various crystals.

MARY. But where does the crystallising substance come from?

L. Sometimes out of the rock itself; sometimes from below or above, through the veins. The
entire substance of the contracting rock may be filled with liquid, pressed into it so as to
fill every pore;--or with mineral vapour;--or it may be so charged at one place, and empty
at another. There's no end to the 'may be's.' But all that you need fancy, for our present
purpose, is that hollows in the rocks, like the caves in Derbyshire, are traversed by liquids
or vapour containing certain elements in a more or less free or separate state, which crystallise
on the cave walls.

SIBYL. There now;--Mary has had all her questions answered: it's my turn to have mine.

L. Ah, there's a conspiracy among you, I see. I might have guessed as much.

DORA. I'm sure you ask us questions enough! How can you have the heart, when you dislike so
to be asked them yourself?

L. My dear child, if people do not answer questions, it does not matter how many they are asked,
because they've no trouble with them. Now, when I ask you questions, I never expect to be answered;
but when you ask me, you always do; and it's not fair.

DORA. Very well, we shall understand, next time.

SIBYL. No, but seriously, we all want to ask one thing more, quite dreadfully.

L. And I don't want to be asked it, quite dreadfully; but you'll have your own way, of course.

SIBYL. We none of us understand about the lower Pthah. It was not merely yesterday; but in
all we have read about him in Wilkinson, or in any book, we cannot understand what the Egyptians
put their god into that ugly little deformed shape for.

L. Well, I'm glad it's that sort of question; because I can answer anything I like, to that.

EGYPT. Anything you like will do quite well for us; we shall be pleased with the answer, if
you are.

L. I am not so sure of that, most gracious queen; for I must begin by the statement that queens
seem to have disliked all sorts of work, in those days, as much as some queens dislike sewing
to-day.

EGYPT. Now, it's too bad! and just when I was trying to say the civillest thing I could!

L. But, Egypt, why did you tell me you disliked sewing so?

EGYPT. Did not I show you how the thread cuts my fingers? and I always get cramp, somehow,
in my neck, if I sew long.

L. Well, I suppose the Egyptian queens thought every body got cramp in their neck, if they
sewed long; and that thread always cut people's fingers. At all events, every kind of manual
labour was despised both by them, and the Greeks; and, while they owned the real good and fruit
of it, they yet held it a degradation to all who practised it. Also, knowing the laws of life
thoroughly, they perceived that the special practice necessary to bring any manual art to perfection
strengthened the body distortedly; one energy or member gaining at the expense of the rest.
They especially dreaded and despised any kind of work that had to be done near fire: yet, feeling
what they owed to it in metal-work, as the basis of all other work, they expressed this mixed
reverence and scorn in the varied types of the lame Hephæstus, and the lower Pthah.

SIBYL. But what did you mean by making him say 'everything great I can make small, and everything
small great?'

L. I had my own separate meaning in that. We have seen in modern times the power of the lower
Pthah developed in a separate way, which no Greek nor Egyptian could have conceived. It is
the character of pure and eyeless manual labour to conceive everything as subjected to it:
and, in reality, to disgrace and diminish all that is so subjected; aggrandising itself, and
the thought of itself, at the expense of all noble things. I heard an orator, and a good one
too, at the Working Men's College, the other day, make a great point in a description of our
railroads; saying, with grandly conducted emphasis, 'They have made man greater, and the world
less.' His working audience were mightily pleased; they thought it so very fine a thing to
be made bigger themselves; and all the rest of the world less. I should have enjoyed asking
them (but it would have been a pity--they were so pleased), how much less they would like to
have the world made;--and whether, at present, those of them really felt the biggest men, who
lived in the least houses.

SIBYL. But then, why did you make Pthah say that he could make weak things strong, and small
things great?

L. My dear, he is a boaster and self-assertor, by nature; but it is so far true. For instance,
we used to have a fair in our neighbourhood--a very fine fair we thought it. You never saw
such an one; but if you look at the engraving of Turner's 'St. Catherine's Hill,' you will
see what it was like. There were curious booths, carried on poles; and peep-shows; and music,
with plenty of drums and cymbals; and much barley-sugar and gingerbread, and the like: and
in the alleys of this fair the London populace would enjoy themselves, after their fashion,
very thoroughly. Well, the little Pthah set to work upon it one day; he made the wooden poles
into iron ones, and put them across, like his own crooked legs, so that you always fall over
them if you don't look where you are going; and he turned all the canvas into panes of glass,
and put it up on his iron cross-poles; and made all the little booths into one great booth;
and people said it was very fine, and a new style of architecture; and Mr. Dickens said nothing
was ever like it in Fairyland, which was very true. And then the little Pthah set to work to
put fine fairings in it; and he painted the Nineveh bulls afresh, with the blackest eyes he
could paint (because he had none himself), and he got the angels down from Lincoln choir, and
gilded their wings like his gingerbread of old times; and he sent for everything else he could
think of, and put it in his booth. There are the casts of Niobe and her children; and the Chimpanzee;
and the wooden Caffres and New-Zealanders; and the Shakespeare House; and Le Grand Blondin,
and Le Petit Blondin; and Handel; and Mozart; and no end of shops, and buns, and beer; and
all the little-Pthah-worshippers say, never was anything so sublime!

SIBYL. Now, do you mean to say you never go to these Crystal Palace concerts? They're as good
as good can be.

L. I don't go to the thundering things with a million of bad voices in them. When I want a
song, I get Julia Mannering and Lucy Bertram and Counsellor Pleydell to sing 'We be three poor
Mariners' to me; then I've no headache next morning. But I do go to the smaller concerts, when
I can; for they are very good, as you say, Sibyl: and I always get a reserved seat somewhere
near the orchestra, where I am sure I can see the kettle-drummer drum.

SIBYL. Now do be serious, for one minute.

L. I am serious--never was more so. You know one can't see the modulation of violinists' fingers,
but one can see the vibration of the drummer's hand; and it's lovely.

SIBYL. But fancy going to a concert, not to hear, but to see!

L. Yes, it is very absurd. The quite right thing, I believe, is to go there to talk. I confess,
however, that in most music, when very well done, the doing of it is to me the chiefly interesting
part of the business. I'm always thinking how good it would be for the fat, supercilious people,
who care so little for their half-crown's worth, to be set to try and do a half-crown's worth
of anything like it.

MARY. But surely that Crystal Palace is a great good and help to the people of London?

L. The fresh air of the Norwood hills is, or was, my dear; but they are spoiling that with
smoke as fast as they can. And the palace (as they call it) is a better place for them, by
much, than the old fair; and it is always there, instead of for three days only; and it shuts
up at proper hours of night. And good use may be made of the things in it, if you know how:
but as for its teaching the people, it will teach them nothing but the lowest of the lower
Pthah's work--nothing but hammer and tongs. I saw a wonderful piece, of his doing, in the place,
only the other day. Some unhappy metal-worker--I am not sure if it was not a metal-working
firm--had taken three years to make a Golden eagle.

SIBYL. Of real gold?

L. No; of bronze, or copper, or some of their foul patent metal--it is no matter what. I meant
a model of our chief British eagle. Every feather was made separately; and every filament of
every feather separately, and so joined on; and all the quills modelled of the right length
and right section, and at last the whole cluster of them fastened together. You know, children,
I don't think much of my own drawing; but take my proud word for once, that when I go to the
Zoological Gardens, and happen to have a bit of chalk in my pocket, and the Gray Harpy will
sit, without screwing his head round, for thirty seconds,--I can do a better thing of him in
that time than the three years' work of this industrious firm. For, during the thirty seconds,
the eagle is my object,--not myself; and during the three years, the firm's object, in every
fibre of bronze it made, was itself, and not the eagle. That is the true meaning of the little
Pthah's having no eyes--he can see only himself. The Egyptian beetle was not quite the full
type of him; our northern ground beetle is a truer one. It is beautiful to see it at work,
gathering its treasures (such as they are) into little round balls; and pushing them home with
the strong wrong end of it,--head downmost all the way,--like a modern political economist
with his ball of capital, declaring that a nation can stand on its vices better than on its
virtues. But away with you, children, now, for I'm getting cross.

DORA. I'm going down-stairs; I shall take care, at any rate, that there are no little Pthahs
in the kitchen cupboards.

LECTURE IV.

THE CRYSTAL ORDERS.

     A working Lecture, in the large Schoolroom; with
     experimental Interludes The great bell has rung
     unexpectedly.

KATHLEEN (entering disconsolate, though first at the summons). Oh dear, oh dear, what a day!
Was ever anything so provoking! just when we wanted to crystallise ourselves;--and I'm sure
it's going to rain all day long.

L. So am I, Kate. The sky has quite an Irish way with it But I don't see why Irish girls should
also look so dismal. Fancy that you don't want to crystallise yourselves: you didn't, the day
before yesterday, and you were not unhappy when it rained then.

FLORRIE. Ah! but we do want to-day; and the rain's so tiresome.

L. That is to say, children, that because you are all the richer by the expectation of playing
at a new game, you choose to make yourselves unhappier than when you had nothing to look forward
to, but the old ones.

ISABEL. But then, to have to wait--wait--wait; and before we've tried it;--and perhaps it will
rain to-morrow, too!

L. It may also rain the day after to-morrow. We can make ourselves uncomfortable to any extent
with perhapses, Isabel. You may stick perhapses into your little minds, like pins, till you
are as uncomfortable as the Lilliputians made Gulliver with their arrows, when he would not
lie quiet.

ISABEL. But what are we to do to-day?

L. To be quiet, for one thing, like Gulliver when he saw there was nothing better to be done.
And to practise patience. I can tell you children, that requires nearly as much practising
as music; and we are continually losing our lessons when the master comes. Now, to-day, here's
a nice little adagio lesson for us, if we play it properly.

ISABEL. But I don't like that sort of lesson. I can't play it properly.

L. Can you play a Mozart sonata yet, Isabel? The more need to practise. All one's life is a
music, if one touches the notes rightly, and in time. But there must be no hurry.

KATHLEEN. I'm sure there's no music in stopping in on a rainy day.

L. There's no music in a 'rest,' Katie, that I know of: but there's the making of music in
it. And people are always missing that part of the life-melody; and scrambling on without counting--not
that it's easy to count; but nothing on which so much depends ever is easy. People are always
talking of perseverance, and courage, and fortitude; but patience is the finest and worthiest
part of fortitude,--and the rarest, too. I know twenty persevering girls for one patient one:
but it is only that twenty-first who can do her work, out and out, or enjoy it. For patience
lies at the root of all pleasures, as well as of all powers. Hope herself ceases to be happiness,
when Impatience companions her.

     (ISABEL and LILY sit down on the floor, and fold their
     hands. The others follow their example.)

Good children! but that's not quite the way of it, neither. Folded hands are not necessarily
resigned ones. The Patience who really smiles at grief usually stands, or walks, or even runs:
she seldom sits; though she may sometimes have to do it, for many a day, poor thing, by monuments;
or like Chaucer's, 'with facë pale, upon a hill of sand.' But we are not reduced to that to-day.
Suppose we use this calamitous forenoon to choose the shapes we are to crystallise into? we
know nothing about them yet.

     (The pictures of resignation rise from the floor, not in
     the patientest manner. General applause.)

MARY (with one or two others). The very thing we wanted to ask you about!

LILY. We looked at the books about crystals, but they are so dreadful.

L. Well, Lily, we must go through a little dreadfulness, that's a fact: no road to any good
knowledge is wholly among the lilies and the grass; there is rough climbing to be done always.
But the crystal-books are a little too dreadful, most of them, I admit; and we shall have to
be content with very little of their help. You know, as you cannot stand on each other's heads,
you can only make yourselves into the sections of crystals,--the figures they show when they
are cut through; and we will choose some that will be quite easy. You shall make diamonds of
yourselves----

ISABEL. Oh, no, no! we won't be diamonds, please.

L. Yes, you shall, Isabel; they are very pretty things, if the jewellers, and the kings and
queens, would only let them alone. You shall make diamonds of yourselves, and rubies of yourselves,
and emeralds; and Irish diamonds; two of those--with Lily in the middle of one, which will
be very orderly, of course; and Kathleen in the middle of the other, for which we will hope
the best;--and you shall make Derbyshire spar of yourselves, and Iceland spar, and gold, and
silver, and--Quicksilver there's enough of in you, without any making.

MARY. Now, you know, the children will be getting quite wild: we must really get pencils and
paper, and begin properly.

L. Wait a minute, Miss Mary; I think as we've the school room clear to-day, I'll try to give
you some notion of the three great orders or ranks of crystals, into which all the others seem
more or less to fall. We shall only want one figure a day, in the playground; and that can
be drawn in a minute: but the general ideas had better be fastened first. I must show you a
great many minerals; so let me have three tables wheeled into the three windows, that we may
keep our specimens separate;--we will keep the three orders of crystals on separate tables.

     (First Interlude, of pushing and pulling, and spreading of
     baize covers. VIOLET, not particularly minding what she is
     about, gets herself jammed into a corner, and bid to stand
     out of the way; on which she devotes herself to
     meditation.)

VIOLET (after interval of meditation). How strange it is that everything seems to divide into
threes!

L. Everything doesn't divide into threes. Ivy won't, though shamrock will; and daisies won't,
though lilies will.

VIOLET. But all the nicest things seem to divide into threes.

L. Violets won't.

VIOLET. No; I should think not, indeed! But I mean the great things.

L. I've always heard the globe had four quarters.

ISABEL. Well; but you know you said it hadn't any quarters at all. So mayn't it really be divided
into three?

L. If it were divided into no more than three, on the outside of it, Isabel, it would be a
fine world to live in; and if it were divided into three in the inside of it, it would soon
be no world to live in at all.

DORA. We shall never get to the crystals, at this rate. (Aside to MARY.) He will get off into
political economy before we know where we are. (Aloud.) But the crystals are divided into three,
then?

L. No; but there are three general notions by which we may best get hold of them. Then between
these notions there are other notions.

LILY (alarmed). A great many? And shall we have to learn them all?

L. More than a great many--a quite infinite many. So you cannot learn them all.

LILY (greatly relieved). Then may we only learn the three?

L. Certainly; unless, when you have got those three notions, you want to have some more notions;--which
would not surprise me. But we'll try for the three, first. Katie, you broke your coral necklace
this morning?

KATHLEEN. Oh! who told you? It was in jumping. I'm so sorry!

L. I'm very glad. Can you fetch me the beads of it?

KATHLEEN. I've lost some; here are the rest in my pocket, if I can only get them out.

L. You mean to get them out some day, I suppose; so try now. I want them.

     (KATHLEEN empties her pocket on the floor. The beads
     disperse. The School disperses also. Second
     Interlude--hunting piece.)

L. (after waiting patiently for a quarter of an hour, to ISABEL, who comes up from under the
table with her hair all about her ears, and the last findable beads in her hand). Mice are
useful little things sometimes. Now, mousie, I want all those beads crystallised. How many
ways are there of putting them in order?

ISABEL. Well, first one would string them, I suppose?

L. Yes, that's the first way. You cannot string ultimate atoms; but you can put them in a row,
and then they fasten themselves together, somehow, into a long rod or needle. We will call
these 'Needle-crystals.' What would be the next way?

ISABEL. I suppose, as we are to get together in the playground, when it stops raining, in different
shapes?

L. Yes; put the beads together, then, in the simplest form you can, to begin with. Put them
into a square, and pack them close.

ISABEL (after careful endeavour). I can't get them closer.

L. That will do. Now you may see, beforehand, that if you try to throw yourselves into square
in this confused way, you will never know your places; so you had better consider every square
as made of rods, put side by side. Take four beads of equal size, first, Isabel; put them into
a little square. That, you may consider as made up of two rods of two beads each. Then you
can make a square a size larger, out of three rods of three. Then the next square may be a
size larger. How many rods, Lily?

LILY. Four rods of four beads each, I suppose.

L. Yes, and then five rods of five, and so on. But now, look here; make another square of four
beads again. You see they leave a little opening in the centre.

ISABEL (pushing two opposite ones closer together). Now they don't.

L. No; but now it isn't a square; and by pushing the two together you have pushed the two others
farther apart.

ISABEL. And yet, somehow, they all seem closer than they were!

L. Yes; for before, each of them only touched two of the others, but now each of the two in
the middle touches the other three. Take away one of the outsiders, Isabel; now you have three
in a triangle--the smallest triangle you can make out of the beads. Now put a rod of three
beads on at one side. So, you have a triangle of six beads; but just the shape of the first
one. Next a rod of four on the side of that; and you have a triangle of ten beads: then a rod
of five on the side of that; and you have a triangle of fifteen. Thus you have a square with
five beads on the side, and a triangle with five beads on the side; equal-sided, therefore,
like the square. So, however few or many you may be, you may soon learn how to crystallise
quickly into these two figures, which are the foundation of form in the commonest, and therefore
actually the most important, as well as in the rarest, and therefore, by our esteem, the most
important, minerals of the world. Look at this in my hand.

VIOLET. Why, it is leaf-gold!

L. Yes; but beaten by no man's hammer; or rather, not beaten at all, but woven. Besides, feel
the weight of it. There is gold enough there to gild the walls and ceiling, if it were beaten thin.

VIOLET. How beautiful! And it glitters like a leaf covered with frost.

L. You only think it so beautiful because you know it is gold. It is not prettier, in reality,
than a bit of brass: for it is Transylvanian gold; and they say there is a foolish gnome in
the mines there, who is always wanting to live in the moon, and so alloys all the gold with
a little silver. I don't know how that may be: but the silver always is in the gold; and if
he does it, it's very provoking of him, for no gold is woven so fine anywhere else.

MARY (who has been looking through her magnifying glass). But this is not woven. This is all
made of little triangles.

L. Say 'patched,' then, if you must be so particular. But if you fancy all those triangles,
small as they are (and many of them are infinitely small), made up again of rods, and those
of grains, as we built our great triangle of the beads, what word will you take for the manufacture?

MAY. There's no word--it is beyond words.

L. Yes; and that would matter little, were it not beyond thoughts too. But, at all events,
this yellow leaf of dead gold, shed, not from the ruined woodlands, but the ruined rocks, will
help you to remember the second kind of crystals, Leaf-crystals, or Foliated crystals; though
I show you the form in gold first only to make a strong impression on you, for gold is not
generally, or characteristically, crystallised in leaves; the real type of foliated crystals
is this thing, Mica; which if you once feel well, and break well, you will always know again;
and you will often have occasion to know it, for you will find it everywhere, nearly, in hill
countries.

KATHLEEN. If we break it well! May we break it?

L. To powder, if you like.

     (Surrenders plate of brown mica to public investigation.
     Third Interlude. It sustains severely philosophical
     treatment at all hands.)

FLORRIE. (to whom the last fragments have descended) Always leaves, and leaves, and nothing
but leaves, or white dust!

L. That dust itself is nothing but finer leaves.

     (Shows them to FLORRIE through magnifying glass.)

ISABEL. (peeping over FLORRIE'S shoulder). But then this bit under the glass looks like that
bit out of the glass! If we could break this bit under the glass, what would it be like?

L. It would be all leaves still.

ISABEL. And then if we broke those again?

L. All less leaves still.

ISABEL (impatient). And if we broke them again, and again, and again, and again, and again?

L. Well, I suppose you would come to a limit, if you could only see it. Notice that the little
flakes already differ somewhat from the large ones: because I can bend them up and down, and
they stay bent; while the large flake, though it bent easily a little way, sprang back when
you let it go, and broke, when you tried to bend it far. And a large mass would not bend at all.

MARY. Would that leaf gold separate into finer leaves, in the same way?

L. No; and therefore, as I told you, it is not a characteristic specimen of a foliated crystallisation.
The little triangles are portions of solid crystals, and so they are in this, which looks like
a black mica; but you see it is made up of triangles like the gold, and stands, almost accurately,
as an intermediate link, in crystals, between mica and gold. Yet this is the commonest, as
gold the rarest, of metals.

MARY. Is it iron? I never saw iron so bright.

L. It is rust of iron, finely crystallised: from its resemblance to mica, it is often called
micaceous iron.

KATHLEEN. May we break this, too?

L. No, for I could not easily get such another crystal; besides, it would not break like the
mica; it is much harder. But take the glass again, and look at the fineness of the jagged edges
of the triangles where they lap over each other. The gold has the same: but you see them better
here, terrace above terrace, countless, and in successive angles, like superb fortified bastions.

MAY. But all foliated crystals are not made of triangles?

L. Far from it: mica is occasionally so, but usually of hexagons; and here is a foliated crystal
made of squares, which will show you that the leaves of the rock-land have their summer green,
as well as their autumnal gold.

FLORRIE. Oh! oh! oh! (jumps for joy).

L. Did you never see a bit of green leaf before, Florrie?

FLORRIE. Yes, but never so bright as that, and not in a stone.

L. If you will look at the leaves of the trees in sunshine after a shower, you will find they
are much brighter than that; and surely they are none the worse for being on stalks instead
of in stones?

FLORRIE. Yes, but then there are so many of them, one never looks, I suppose.

L. Now you have it, Florrie.

VIOLET (sighing). There are so many beautiful things we never see!

L. You need not sigh for that, Violet; but I will tell you what we should all sigh for,--that
there are so many ugly things we never see.

VIOLET. But we don't want to see ugly things!

L. You had better say, 'We don't want to suffer them.' You ought to be glad in thinking how
much more beauty God has made, than human eyes can ever see; but not glad in thinking how much
more evil man has made, than his own soul can ever conceive, much more than his hands can ever
heal.

VIOLET. I don't understand;--how is that like the leaves?

L. The same law holds in our neglect of multiplied pain, as in our neglect of multiplied beauty.
Florrie jumps for joy at sight of half an inch of a green leaf in a brown stone; and takes
more notice of it than of all the green in the wood: and you, or I, or any of us, would be
unhappy if any single human creature beside us were in sharp pain; but we can read, at breakfast,
day after day, of men being killed, and of women and children dying of hunger, faster than
the leaves strew the brooks in Vallombrosa;--and then go out to play croquet, as if nothing
had happened.

MAY. But we do not see the people being killed or dying.

L. You did not see your brother, when you got the telegram the other day, saying he was ill,
May; but you cried for him and played no croquet. But we cannot talk of these things now; and
what is more, you must let me talk straight on, for a little while; and ask no questions till
I've done: for we branch ('exfoliate,' I should say, mineralogically) always into something
else,--though that's my fault more than yours; but I must go straight on now. You have got
a distinct notion, I hope, of leaf-crystals; and you see the sort of look they have: you can
easily remember that 'folium' is Latin for a leaf, and that the separate flakes of mica, or
any other such stones, are called 'folia;' but, because mica is the most characteristic of
these stones, other things that are like it in structure are called 'micas;' thus we have Uran-mica,
which is the green leaf I showed you; and Copper-mica, which is another like it, made chiefly
of copper; and this foliated iron is called 'micaceous iron.' You have then these two great
orders, Needle-crystals, made (probably) of grains in rows; and Leaf-crystals, made (probably)
of needles interwoven; now, lastly, there are crystals of a third order, in heaps, or knots,
or masses, which may be made, either of leaves laid one upon another, or of needles bound like
Roman fasces; and mica itself, when it is well crystallised, puts itself into such masses,
as if to show us how others are made. Here is a brown six-sided crystal, quite as beautifully
chiselled at the sides as any castle tower; but you see it is entirely built of folia of mica,
one laid above another, which break away the moment I touch the edge with my knife. Now, here
is another hexagonal tower, of just the same size and colour, which I want you to compare with
the mica carefully; but as I cannot wait for you to do it just now, I must tell you quickly
what main differences to look for. First, you will feel it is far heavier than the mica. Then,
though its surface looks quite micaceous in the folia of it, when you try them with the knife,
you will find you cannot break them away----

KATHLEEN. May I try?

L. Yes, you mistrusting Katie. Here's my strong knife for you. (Experimental pause. KATHLEEN,
doing her best.) You'll have that knife shutting on your finger presently, Kate; and I don't
know a girl who would like less to have her hand tied up for a week.

KATHLEEN (who also does not like to be beaten--giving up the knife despondently). What can
the nasty hard thing be?

L. It is nothing but indurated clay, Kate: very hard set certainly, yet not so hard as it might
be. If it were thoroughly well crystallised, you would see none of those micaceous fractures;
and the stone would be quite red and clear, all through.

KATHLEEN. Oh, cannot you show us one?

L. Egypt can, if you ask her; she has a beautiful one in the clasp of her favourite bracelet.

KATHLEEN. Why, that's a ruby!

L. Well, so is that thing you've been scratching at.

KATHLEEN. My goodness!

     (Takes up the stone again, very delicately; and drops it.
     General consternation.)

L. Never mind, Katie; you might drop it from the top of the house, and do it no harm. But though
you really are a very good girl, and as good-natured as anybody can possibly be, remember,
you have your faults, like other people; and, if I were you, the next time I wanted to assert
anything energetically, I would assert it by 'my badness,' not 'my goodness.'

KATHLEEN. Ah, now, it's too bad of you!

L. Well, then, I'll invoke, on occasion, my 'too-badness.' But you may as well pick up the
ruby, now you have dropped it; and look carefully at the beautiful hexagonal lines which gleam
on its surface; and here is a pretty white sapphire (essentially the same stone as the ruby),
in which you will see the same lovely structure, like the threads of the finest white cobweb.
I do not know what is the exact method of a ruby's construction; but you see by these lines,
what fine construction there is, even in this hardest of stones (after the diamond), which
usually appears as a massive lump or knot. There is therefore no real mineralogical distinction
between needle crystals and knotted crystals, but, practically, crystallised masses throw themselves
into one of the three groups we have been examining to-day; and appear either as Needles, as
Folia, or as Knots; when they are in needles (or fibres), they make the stones or rocks formed
out of them 'fibrous;' when they are in folia, they make them 'foliated;' when they are in
knots (or grains), 'granular.' Fibrous rocks are comparatively rare, in mass; but fibrous minerals
are innumerable; and it is often a question which really no one but a young lady could possibly
settle, whether one should call the fibres composing them 'threads' or 'needles.' Here is amianthus,
for instance, which is quite as fine and soft as any cotton thread you ever sewed with; and
here is sulphide of bismuth, with sharper points and brighter lustre than your finest needles
have; and fastened in white webs of quartz more delicate than your finest lace; and here is
sulphide of antimony, which looks like mere purple wool, but it is all of purple needle crystals;
and here is red oxide of copper (you must not breathe on it as you look, or you may blow some
of the films of it off the stone), which is simply a woven tissue of scarlet silk. However,
these finer thread forms are comparatively rare, while the bolder and needle-like crystals
occur constantly; so that, I believe, 'Needle-crystal' is the best word (the grand one is 'Acicular
crystal,' but Sibyl will tell you it is all the same, only less easily understood; and therefore
more scientific). Then the Leaf-crystals, as I said, form an immense mass of foliated rocks;
and the Granular crystals, which are of many kinds, form essentially granular, or granitic
and porphyritic rocks; and it is always a point of more interest to me (and I think will ultimately
be to you), to consider the causes which force a given mineral to take any one of these three
general forms, than what the peculiar geometrical limitations are, belonging to its own crystals.[150]
It is more interesting to me, for instance, to try and find out why the red oxide of copper,
usually crystallising in cubes or octahedrons, makes itself exquisitely, out of its cubes,
into this red silk in one particular Cornish mine, than what are the absolutely necessary angles
of the octahedron, which is its common form. At all events, that mathematical part of crystallography
is quite beyond girls' strength; but these questions of the various tempers and manners of
crystals are not only comprehensible by you, but full of the most curious teaching for you.
For in the fulfilment, to the best of their power, of their adopted form under given circumstances,
there are conditions entirely resembling those of human virtue; and indeed expressible under
no term so proper as that of the Virtue, or Courage of crystals:--which, if you are not afraid
of the crystals making you ashamed of yourselves, we will try to get some notion of, to-morrow.
But it will be a bye-lecture, and more about yourselves than the minerals, Don't come unless
you like.

MARY. I'm sure the crystals will make us ashamed of ourselves; but we'll come, for all that.

L. Meantime, look well and quietly over these needle, or thread crystals, and those on the
other two tables, with magnifying glasses, and see what thoughts will come into your little
heads about them. For the best thoughts are generally those which come without being forced,
one does not know how. And so I hope you will get through your wet day patiently.

LECTURE V.

CRYSTAL VIRTUES.

     A quiet talk, in the afternoon, by the sunniest window of
     the Drawing-room. Present, FLORRIE, ISABEL, MAY, LUCILLA,
     KATHLEEN, DORA, MARY, and some others, who have saved time
     for the bye-Lecture.

L. So you have really come, like good girls, to be made ashamed of yourselves?

DORA (very meekly). No, we needn't be made so; we always are.

L. Well, I believe that's truer than most pretty speeches: but you know, you saucy girl, some
people have more reason to be so than others. Are you sure everybody is, as well as you?

THE GENERAL VOICE. Yes, yes; everybody.

L. What! Florrie ashamed of herself?

     (FLORRIE hides behind the curtain.)

L. And Isabel?

     (ISABEL hides under the table.)

L. And May?

     (MAY runs into the corner behind the piano.)

L. And Lucilla?

     (LUCILLA hides her face in her hands.)

L. Dear, dear; but this will never do. I shall have to tell you of the faults of the crystals,
instead of virtues, to put you in heart again.

MAY (coming out of her corner). Oh! have the crystals faults, like us?

L. Certainly, May. Their best virtues are shown in fighting their faults. And some have a great
many faults; and some are very naughty crystals indeed.

FLORRIE (from behind her curtain). As naughty as me?

ISABEL (peeping from under the table cloth). Or me?

L. Well, I don't know. They never forget their syntax, children, when once they've been taught
it. But I think some of them are, on the whole, worse than any of you. Not that it's amiable
of you to look so radiant, all in a minute, on that account.

DORA. Oh! but it's so much more comfortable.

     (Everybody seems to recover their spirits. Eclipse of
     FLORRIE and ISABEL terminates.)

L. What kindly creatures girls are, after all, to their neighbours' failings! I think you may
be ashamed of yourselves indeed, now, children! I can tell you, you shall hear of the highest
crystalline merits that I can think of, to-day: and I wish there were more of them; but crystals
have a limited, though a stern, code of morals; and their essential virtues are but two;--the
first is to be pure, and the second to be well shaped.

MARY. Pure! Does that mean clear--transparent?

L. No; unless in the case of a transparent substance. You cannot have a transparent crystal
of gold; but you may have a perfectly pure one.

ISABEL. But you said it was the shape that made things be crystals; therefore, oughtn't their
shape to be their first virtue, not their second?

L. Right, you troublesome mousie. But I call their shape only their second virtue, because
it depends on time and accident, and things which the crystal cannot help. If it is cooled
too quickly, or shaken, it must take what shape it can; but it seems as if, even then, it had
in itself the power of rejecting impurity, if it has crystalline life enough. Here is a crystal
of quartz, well enough shaped in its way; but it seems to have been languid and sick at heart;
and some white milky substance has got into it, and mixed itself up with it, all through. It
makes the quartz quite yellow, if you hold it up to the light, and milky blue on the surface.
Here is another, broken into a thousand separate facets, and out of all traceable shape; but
as pure as a mountain spring. I like this one best.

THE AUDIENCE. So do I--and I--and I.

MARY. Would a crystallographer?

L. I think so. He would find many more laws curiously exemplified in the irregularly grouped
but pure crystal. But it is a futile question, this of first or second. Purity is in most cases
a prior, if not a nobler, virtue; at all events it is most convenient to think about it first.

MARY. But what ought we to think about it? Is there much to be thought--I mean, much to puzzle one?

L. I don't know what you call 'much.' It is a long time since I met with anything in which
there was little. There's not much in this, perhaps. The crystal must be either dirty or clean,--and
there's an end. So it is with one's hands, and with one's heart--only you can wash your hands
without changing them, but not hearts, nor crystals. On the whole, while you are young, it
will be as well to take care that your hearts don't want much washing; for they may perhaps
need wringing also, when they do.

     (Audience doubtful and uncomfortable. LUCILLA at last
     takes courage.)

LUCILLA. Oh! but surely, sir, we cannot make our hearts clean?

L. Not easily, Lucilla; so you had better keep them so when they are.

LUCILLA. When they are! But, sir--

L. Well?

LUCILLA. Sir--surely--are we not told that they are all evil?

L. Wait a little, Lucilla; that is difficult ground you are getting upon; and we must keep
to our crystals, till at least we understand what their good and evil consist in; they may
help us afterwards to some useful hints about our own. I said that their goodness consisted
chiefly in purity of substance, and perfectness of form: but those are rather the effects of
their goodness, than the goodness itself. The inherent virtues of the crystals, resulting in
these outer conditions, might really seem to be best described in the words we should use respecting
living creatures--'force of heart' and steadiness of purpose.' There seem to be in some crystals,
from the beginning, an unconquerable purity of vital power, and strength of crystal spirit.
Whatever dead substance, unacceptant of this energy, comes in their way, is either rejected,
or forced to take some beautiful subordinate form; the purity of the crystal remains unsullied,
and every atom of it bright with coherent energy. Then the second condition is, that from the
beginning of its whole structure, a fine crystal seems to have determined that it will be of
a certain size and of a certain shape; it persists in this plan, and completes it. Here is
a perfect crystal of quartz for you. It is of an unusual form, and one which it might seem
very difficult to build--a pyramid with convex sides, composed of other minor pyramids. But
there is not a flaw in its contour throughout; not one of its myriads of component sides but
is as bright as a jeweller's facetted work (and far finer, if you saw it close). The crystal
points are as sharp as javelins; their edges will cut glass with a touch. Anything more resolute,
consummate, determinate in form, cannot be conceived. Here, on the other hand, is a crystal
of the same substance, in a perfectly simple type of form--a plain six-sided prism; but from
its base to its point,--and it is nine inches long,--it has never for one instant made up its
mind what thickness it will have. It seems to have begun by making itself as thick as it thought
possible with the quantity of material at command. Still not being as thick as it would like
to be, it has clumsily glued on more substance at one of its sides. Then it has thinned itself,
in a panic of economy; then puffed itself out again; then starved one side to enlarge another;
then warped itself quite out of its first line. Opaque, rough-surfaced, jagged on the edge,
distorted in the spine, it exhibits a quite human image of decrepitude and dishonour; but the
worst of all the signs of its decay and helplessness, is that half-way up, a parasite crystal,
smaller, but just as sickly, has rooted itself in the side of the larger one, eating out a
cavity round its root, and then growing backwards, or downwards, contrary to the direction
of the main crystal. Yet I cannot trace the least difference in purity of substance between
the first most noble stone, and this ignoble and dissolute one. The impurity of the last is
in its will, or want of will.

MARY. Oh, if we could but understand the meaning of it all!

L. We can understand all that is good for us. It is just as true for us, as for the crystal,
that the nobleness of life depends on its consistency,--clearness of purpose,--quiet and ceaseless
energy. All doubt, and repenting, and botching, and retouching, and wondering what it will
be best to do next, are vice, as well as misery.

MARY (much wondering). But must not one repent when one does wrong, and hesitate when one can't
see one's way?

L. You have no business at all to do wrong; nor to get into any way that you cannot see. Your
intelligence should always be far in advance of your act. Whenever you do not know what you
are about, you are sure to be doing wrong.

KATHLEEN. Oh, dear, but I never know what I am about!

L. Very true, Katie, but it is a great deal to know, if you know that. And you find that you
have done wrong afterwards; and perhaps some day you may begin to know, or at least, think,
what you are about.

ISABEL. But surely people can't do very wrong if they don't know, can they? I mean, they can't
be very naughty. They can be wrong, like Kathleen or me, when we make mistakes; but not wrong
in the dreadful way. I can't express what I mean; but there are two sorts of wrong are there not?

L. Yes, Isabel; but you will find that the great difference is between kind and unkind wrongs,
not between meant and unmeant wrong. Very few people really mean to do wrong,--in a deep sense,
none. They only don't know what they are about. Cain did not mean to do wrong when he killed Abel.

     (ISABEL draws a deep breath, and opens her eyes very
     wide.)

L. No, Isabel; and there are countless Cains among us now, who kill their brothers by the score
a day, not only for less provocation than Cain had, but for no provocation,--and merely for
what they can make of their bones,--yet do not think they are doing wrong in the least. Then
sometimes you have the business reversed, as over in America these last years, where you have
seen Abel resolutely killing Cain, and not thinking he is doing wrong. The great difficulty
is always to open people's eyes: to touch their feelings, and break their hearts, is easy;
the difficult thing is to break their heads. What does it matter, as long as they remain stupid,
whether you change their feelings or not? You cannot be always at their elbow to tell them
what is right: and they may just do as wrong as before, or worse; and their best intentions
merely make the road smooth for them,--you know where, children. For it is not the place itself
that is paved with them, as people say so often. You can't pave the bottomless pit; but you
may the road to it.

MAY. Well, but if people do as well as they can see how, surely that is the right for them,
isn't it?

L. No, May, not a bit of it; right is right, and wrong is wrong. It is only the fool who does
wrong, and says he 'did it for the best.' And if there's one sort of person in the world that
the Bible speaks harder of than another, it is fools. Their particular and chief way of saying
'There is no God' is this, of declaring that whatever their 'public opinion' may be, is right:
and that God's opinion is of no consequence.

MAY. But surely nobody can always know what is right?

L. Yes, you always can, for to-day; and if you do what you see of it to-day, you will see more
of it, and more clearly, to-morrow. Here, for instance, you children are at school, and have
to learn French, and arithmetic, and music, and several other such things. That is your 'right'
for the present; the 'right' for us, your teachers, is to see that you learn as much as you
can, without spoiling your dinner, your sleep, or your play; and that what you do learn, you
learn well. You all know when you learn with a will, and when you dawdle. There's no doubt
of conscience about that, I suppose?

VIOLET. No; but if one wants to read an amusing book, instead of learning one's lesson?

L. You don't call that a 'question,' seriously, Violet? You are then merely deciding whether
you will resolutely do wrong or not.

MARY. But, in after life, how many fearful difficulties may arise, however one tries to know
or to do what is right!

L. You are much too sensible a girl, Mary, to have felt that, whatever you may have seen. A
great many of young ladies' difficulties arise from their falling in love with a wrong person:
but they have no business to let themselves fall in love, till they know he is the right one.

DORA. How many thousands ought he to have a year?

L. (disdaining reply). There are, of course, certain crises of fortune when one has to take
care of oneself, and mind shrewdly what one is about. There is never any real doubt about the
path, but you may have to walk very slowly.

MARY. And if one is forced to do a wrong thing by some one who has authority over you?

L. My dear, no one can be forced to do a wrong thing, for the guilt is in the will: but you
may any day be forced to do a fatal thing, as you might be forced to take poison; the remarkable
law of nature in such cases being, that it is always unfortunate you who are poisoned, and
not the person who gives you the dose. It is a very strange law, but it is a law. Nature merely
sees to the carrying out of the normal operation of arsenic. She never troubles herself to
ask who gave it you. So also you may be starved to death, morally as well as physically, by
other people's faults. You are, on the whole, very good children sitting here to-day;--do you
think that your goodness comes all by your own contriving? or that you are gentle and kind
because your dispositions are naturally more angelic than those of the poor girls who are playing,
with wild eyes, on the dustheaps in the alleys of our great towns; and who will one day fill
their prisons,--or, better, their graves? Heaven only knows where they, and we who have cast
them there, shall stand at last. But the main judgment question will be, I suppose, for all
of us, 'Did you keep a good heart through it?' What you were, others may answer for;--what
you tried to be, you must answer for, yourself. Was the heart pure and true--tell us that?

And so we come back to your sorrowful question, Lucilla, which I put aside a little ago. You
would be afraid to answer that your heart was pure and true, would not you?

LUCILLA. Yes, indeed, sir.

L. Because you have been taught that it is all evil--'only evil continually.' Somehow, often
as people say that, they never seem, to me, to believe it? Do you really believe it?

LUCILLA. Yes, sir; I hope so.

L. That you have an entirely bad heart?

LUCILLA (a little uncomfortable at the substitution of the monosyllable for the dissyllable,
nevertheless persisting in her orthodoxy). Yes, sir.

L. Florrie, I am sure you are tired; I never like you to stay when you are tired; but, you
know, you must not play with the kitten while we're talking.

FLORRIE. Oh! but I'm not tired; and I'm only nursing her. She'll be asleep in my lap directly.

L. Stop! that puts me in mind of something I had to show you, about minerals that are like
hair. I want a hair out of Tittie's tail.

FLORRIE (quite rude, in her surprise, even to the point of repeating expressions). Out of Tittie's
tail!

L. Yes; a brown one: Lucilla, you can get at the tip of it nicely, under Florrie's arm; just
pull one out for me.

LUCILLA. Oh! but, sir, it will hurt her so!

L. Never mind; she can't scratch you while Florrie is holding her. Now that I think of it,
you had better pull out two.

LUCILLA. But then she may scratch Florrie! and it will hurt her so, sir! if you only want brown
hairs, wouldn't two of mine do?

L. Would you really rather pull out your own than Tittie's?

LUCILLA. Oh, of course, if mine will do.

L. But that's very wicked, Lucilla!

LUCILLA. Wicked, sir?

L. Yes; if your heart was not so bad, you would much rather pull all the cat's hairs out, than
one of your own.

LUCILLA. Oh! but sir, I didn't mean bad, like that.

L. I believe, if the truth were told, Lucilla, you would like to tie a kettle to Tittie's tail,
and hunt her round the playground.

LUCILLA. Indeed, I should not, sir.

L. That's not true, Lucilla; you know it cannot be.

LUCILLA. Sir?

L. Certainly it is not;--how can you possibly speak any truth out of such a heart as you have?
It is wholly deceitful.

LUCILLA. Oh! no, no; I don't mean that way; I don't mean that it makes me tell lies, quite out.

L. Only that it tells lies within you?

LUCILLA. Yes.

L. Then, outside of it, you know what is true, and say so; and I may trust the outside of your
heart; but within, it is all foul and false. Is that the way?

LUCILLA. I suppose so: I don't understand it, quite.

L. There is no occasion for understanding it; but do you feel it? Are you sure that your heart
is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked?

LUCILLA (much relieved by finding herself among phrases with which she is acquainted). Yes,
sir. I'm sure of that.

L. (pensively). I'm sorry for it, Lucilla.

LUCILLA. So am I, indeed.

L. What are you sorry with, Lucilla?

LUCILLA. Sorry with, sir?

L. Yes; I mean, where do you feel sorry? in your feet?

LUCILLA (laughing a little). No, sir, of course.

L. In your shoulders, then?

LUCILLA. No, sir.

L. You are sure of that? Because, I fear, sorrow in the shoulders would not be worth much.

LUCILLA. I suppose I feel it in my heart, if I really am sorry.

L. If you really are! Do you mean to say that you are sure you are utterly wicked, and yet
do not care?

LUCILLA. No, indeed; I have cried about it often.

L. Well, then, you are sorry in your heart?

LUCILLA. Yes, when the sorrow is worth anything.

L. Even if it be not, it cannot be anywhere else but there. It is not the crystalline lens
of your eyes which is sorry, when you cry?

LUCILLA. No, sir, of course.

L. Then, have you two hearts; one of which is wicked, and the other grieved? or is one side
of it sorry for the other side?

LUCILLA (weary of cross-examination, and a little vexed). Indeed, sir, you know I can't understand
it; but you know how it is written--'another law in my members, warring against the law of
my mind.'

L. Yes, Lucilla, I know how it is written; but I do not see that it will help us to know that,
if we neither understand what is written, nor feel it. And you will not get nearer to the meaning
of one verse, if, as soon as you are puzzled by it, you escape to another, introducing three
new words--'law,' 'members,' and 'mind'; not one of which you at present know the meaning of;
and respecting which, you probably never will be much wiser; since men like Montesquieu and
Locke have spent great part of their lives in endeavouring to explain two of them.

LUCILLA. Oh! please, sir, ask somebody else.

L. If I thought anyone else could answer better than you, Lucilla, I would; but suppose I try,
instead, myself, to explain your feelings to you?

LUCILLA. Oh, yes; please do.

L. Mind, I say your 'feelings,' not your 'belief.' For I cannot undertake to explain anybody's
beliefs. Still I must try a little, first, to explain the belief also, because I want to draw
it to some issue. As far as I understand what you say, or any one else, taught as you have
been taught, says, on this matter,--you think that there is an external goodness, a whited-sepulchre
kind of goodness, which appears beautiful outwardly, but is within full of uncleanness: a deep
secret guilt, of which we ourselves are not sensible; and which can only be seen by the Maker
of us all. (Approving murmurs from audience.)

L. Is it not so with the body as well as the soul?

     (Looked notes of interrogation.)

L. A skull, for instance, is not a beautiful thing?

     (Grave faces, signifying 'Certainly not,' and 'What
     next?')

L. And if you all could see in each other, with clear eyes, whatever God sees beneath those
fair faces of yours, you would not like it?

     (Murmured 'No's.')

L. Nor would it be good for you?

     (Silence.)

L. The probability being that what God does not allow you to see, He does not wish you to see;
nor even to think of?

     (Silence prolonged.)

L. It would not at all be good for you, for instance, whenever you were washing your faces,
and braiding your hair, to be thinking of the shapes of the jawbones, and of the cartilage
of the nose, and of the jagged sutures of the scalp?

     (Resolutely whispered No's.)

L. Still less, to see through a clear glass the daily processes of nourishment and decay?

     (No.)

L. Still less if instead of merely inferior and preparatory conditions of structure, as in
the skeleton,--or inferior offices of structure, as in operations of life and death,--there
were actual disease in the body; ghastly and dreadful. You would try to cure it; but having
taken such measures as were necessary, you would not think the cure likely to be promoted by
perpetually watching the wounds, or thinking of them. On the contrary, you would be thankful
for every moment of forgetfulness: as, in daily health, you must be thankful that your Maker
has veiled whatever is fearful in your frame under a sweet and manifest beauty; and has made
it your duty, and your only safety, to rejoice in that, both in yourself and in others:--not
indeed concealing, or refusing to believe in sickness, if it come; but never dwelling on it.

Now, your wisdom and duty touching soul-sickness are just the same. Ascertain clearly what
is wrong with you; and so far as you know any means of mending it, take those means, and have
done: when you are examining yourself, never call yourself merely a 'sinner,' that is very
cheap abuse; and utterly useless. You may even get to like it, and be proud of it. But call
yourself a liar, a coward, a sluggard, a glutton, or an evil-eyed jealous wretch, if you indeed
find yourself to be in any wise any of these. Take steady means to check yourself in whatever
fault you have ascertained, and justly accused yourself of. And as soon as you are in active
way of mending, you will be no more inclined to moan over an undefined corruption. For the
rest, you will find it less easy to uproot faults, than to choke them by gaining virtues. Do
not think of your faults; still less of others' faults: in every person who comes near you,
look for what is good and strong: honour that; rejoice in it; and, as you can, try to imitate
it: and your faults will drop off, like dead leaves, when their time comes. If, on looking
back, your whole life should seem rugged as a palm tree stem; still, never mind, so long as
it has been growing; and has its grand green shade of leaves, and weight of honied fruit, at
top. And even if you cannot find much good in yourself at last, think that it does not much
matter to the universe either what you were, or are; think how many people are noble, if you
cannot be; and rejoice in their nobleness. An immense quantity of modern confession of sin,
even when honest, is merely a sickly egotism; which will rather gloat over its own evil, than
lose the centralisation of its interest in itself.

MARY. But then, if we ought to forget ourselves so much, how did the old Greek proverb 'Know
thyself' come to be so highly esteemed?

L. My dear, it is the proverb of proverbs; Apollo's proverb, and the sun's;--but do you think
you can know yourself by looking into yourself? Never. You can know what you are, only by looking
out of yourself. Measure your own powers with those of others; compare your own interests with
those of others; try to understand what you appear to them, as well as what they appear to
you; and judge of yourselves, in all things, relatively and subordinately; not positively:
starting always with a wholesome conviction of the probability that there is nothing particular
about you. For instance, some of you perhaps think you can write poetry. Dwell on your own
feelings and doings:--and you will soon think yourselves Tenth Muses; but forget your own feelings;
and try, instead, to understand a line or two of Chaucer or Dante: and you will soon begin
to feel yourselves very foolish girls--which is much like the fact.

So, something which befalls you may seem a great misfortune;--you meditate over its effects
on you personally; and begin to think that it is a chastisement, or a warning, or a this or
that or the other of profound significance; and that all the angels in heaven have left their
business for a little while, that they may watch its effects on your mind. But give up this
egotistic indulgence of your fancy; examine a little what misfortunes, greater a thousandfold,
are happening, every second, to twenty times worthier persons: and your self-consciousness
will change into pity and humility; and you will know yourself, so far as to understand that
'there hath nothing taken thee but what is common to man.'

Now, Lucilla, these are the practical conclusions which any person of sense would arrive at,
supposing the texts which relate to the inner evil of the heart were as many, and as prominent,
as they are often supposed to be by careless readers. But the way in which common people read
their Bibles is just like the way that the old monks thought hedgehogs ate grapes. They rolled
themselves (it was said), over and over, where the grapes lay on the ground. What fruit stuck
to their spines, they carried off, and ate. So your hedgehoggy readers roll themselves over
and over their Bibles, and declare that whatever sticks to their own spines is Scripture; and
that nothing else is. But you can only get the skins of the texts that way. If you want their
juice, you must press them in cluster. Now, the clustered texts about the human heart, insist,
as a body, not on any inherent corruption in all hearts, but on the terrific distinction between
the bad and the good ones. 'A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth
that which is good; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth that which is
evil.' 'They on the rock are they which, in an honest and good heart, having heard the word,
keep it.' 'Delight thyself in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart.'
'The wicked have bent their bow, that they may privily shoot at him that is upright in heart.'
And so on; they are countless, to the same effect. And, for all of us, the question is not
at all to ascertain how much or how little corruption there is in human nature; but to ascertain
whether, out of all the mass of that nature, we are of the sheep or the goat breed; whether
we are people of upright heart, being shot at, or people of crooked heart, shooting. And, of
all the texts bearing on the subject, this, which is a quite simple and practical order, is
the one you have chiefly to hold in mind. 'Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it
are the issues of life.'

LUCILLA. And yet, how inconsistent the texts seem!

L. Nonsense, Lucilla! do you think the universe is bound to look consistent to a girl of fifteen?
Look up at your own room window;--you can just see it from where you sit. I'm glad that it
is left open, as it ought to be, in so fine a day. But do you see what a black spot it looks,
in the sunlighted wall?

LUCILLA. Yes, it looks as black as ink.

L. Yet you know it is a very bright room when you are inside of it; quite as bright as there
is any occasion for it to be, that its little lady may see to keep it tidy. Well, it is very
probable, also, that if you could look into your heart from the sun's point of view, it might
appear a very black hole indeed; nay, the sun may sometimes think good to tell you that it
looks so to Him; but He will come into it, and make it very cheerful for you, for all that,
if you don't put the shutters up. And the one question for you, remember, is not 'dark or light?'
but 'tidy or untidy?' Look well to your sweeping and garnishing; and be sure it is only the
banished spirit, or some of the seven wickeder ones at his back, who will still whisper to
you that it is all black.

LECTURE VI.

CRYSTAL QUARRELS.

     Full conclave, in Schoolroom. There has been a game at
     crystallisation in the morning, of which various account has
     to be rendered. In particular, everybody has to explain why
     they were always where they were not intended to be.

L. (having received and considered the report). You have got on pretty well, children: but
you know these were easy figures you have been trying. Wait till I have drawn you out the plans
of some crystals of snow!

MARY. I don't think those will be the most difficult:--they are so beautiful that we shall
remember our places better; and then they are all regular, and in stars: it is those twisty
oblique ones we are afraid of.

L. Read Carlyle's account of the battle of Leuthen, and learn Freidrich's 'oblique order.'
You will 'get it done for once, I think, provided you can march as a pair of compasses would.'
But remember, when you can construct the most difficult single figures, you have only learned
half the game--nothing so much as the half, indeed, as the crystals themselves play it.

MARY. Indeed; what else is there?

L. It is seldom that any mineral crystallises alone. Usually two or three, under quite different
crystalline laws, form together. They do this absolutely without flaw or fault, when they are
in fine temper: and observe what this signifies. It signifies that the two, or more, minerals
of different natures agree, somehow, between themselves, how much space each will want;--agree
which of them shall give away to the other at their junction; or in what measure each will
accommodate itself to the other's shape! And then each takes its permitted shape, and allotted
share of space; yielding, or being yielded to, as it builds, till each crystal has fitted itself
perfectly and gracefully to its differently-natured neighbour. So that, in order to practise
this, in even the simplest terms, you must divide into two parties, wearing different colours;
each must choose a different figure to construct; and you must form one of these figures through
the other, both going on at the same time.

MARY. I think we may, perhaps, manage it; but I cannot at all understand how the crystals do.
It seems to imply so much preconcerting of plan, and so much giving way to each other, as if
they really were living.

L. Yes, it implies both concurrence and compromise, regulating all wilfulness of design: and,
more curious still, the crystals do not always give way to each other. They show exactly the
same varieties of temper that human creatures might. Sometimes they yield the required place
with perfect grace and courtesy; forming fantastic, but exquisitely finished groups: and sometimes
they will not yield at all; but fight furiously for their places, losing all shape and honour,
and even their own likeness, in the contest.

MARY. But is not that wholly wonderful? How is it that one never sees it spoken of in books?

L. The scientific men are all busy in determining the constant laws under which the struggle
takes place; these indefinite humours of the elements are of no interest to them. And unscientific
people rarely give themselves the trouble of thinking at all when they look at stones. Not
that it is of much use to think; the more one thinks, the more one is puzzled.

MARY. Surely it is more wonderful than anything in botany?

L. Everything has its own wonders; but, given the nature of the plant, it is easier to understand
what a flower will do, and why it does it, than, given anything we as yet know of stone-nature,
to understand what a crystal will do, and why it does it. You at once admit a kind of volition
and choice, in the flower, but we are not accustomed to attribute anything of the kind to the
crystal. Yet there is, in reality, more likeness to some conditions of human feeling among
stones than among plants. There is a far greater difference between kindly-tempered and ill-tempered
crystals of the same mineral, than between any two specimens of the same flower: and the friendships
and wars of crystals depend more definitely and curiously on their varieties of disposition,
than any associations of flowers. Here, for instance, is a good garnet, living with good mica;
one rich red, and the other silver white: the mica leaves exactly room enough for the garnet
to crystallise comfortably in; and the garnet lives happily in its little white house; fitted
to it, like a pholas in its cell. But here are wicked garnets living with wicked mica. See
what ruin they make of each other! You cannot tell which is which; the garnets look like dull
red stains on the crumbling stone. By the way, I never could understand, if St. Gothard is
a real saint, why he can't keep his garnets in better order. These are all under his care;
but I suppose there are too many of them for him to look after. The streets of Airolo are paved
with them.

MAY. Paved with garnets?

L. With mica-slate and garnets; I broke this bit out of a paving stone. Now garnets and mica
are natural friends, and generally fond of each other; but you see how they quarrel when they
are ill brought up. So it is always. Good crystals are friendly with almost all other good
crystals, however little they chance to see of each other, or however opposite their habits
may be; while wicked crystals quarrel with one another, though they may be exactly alike in
habits, and see each other continually. And of course the wicked crystals quarrel with the
good ones.

ISABEL. Then do the good ones get angry?

L. No, never: they attend to their own work and life; and live it as well as they can, though
they are always the sufferers. Here, for instance, is a rock-crystal of the purest race and
finest temper, who was born, unhappily for him, in a bad neighbourhood, near Beaufort in Savoy;
and he has had to fight with vile calcareous mud all his life. See here, when he was but a
child, it came down on him, and nearly buried him; a weaker crystal would have died in despair;
but he only gathered himself together, like Hercules against the serpents, and threw a layer
of crystal over the clay; conquered it,--imprisoned it,--and lived on. Then, when he was a
little older, came more clay; and poured itself upon him here, at the side; and he has laid
crystal over that, and lived on, in his purity. Then the clay came on at his angles, and tried
to cover them, and round them away; but upon that he threw out buttress-crystals at his angles,
all as true to his own central line as chapels round a cathedral apse; and clustered them round
the clay; and conquered it again. At last the clay came on at his summit, and tried to blunt
his summit; but he could not endure that for an instant; and left his flanks all rough, but
pure; and fought the clay at his crest, and built crest over crest, and peak over peak, till
the clay surrendered at last; and here is his summit, smooth and pure, terminating a pyramid
of alternate clay and crystal, half a foot high!

LILY. Oh, how nice of him! What a dear, brave crystal! But I can't bear to see his flanks all
broken, and the clay within them.

L. Yes; it was an evil chance for him, the being born to such contention; there are some enemies
so base that even to hold them captive is a kind of dishonour. But look, here has been quite
a different kind of struggle: the adverse power has been more orderly, and has fought the pure
crystal in ranks as firm as its own. This is not mere rage and impediment of crowded evil:
here is a disciplined hostility; army against army.

LILY. Oh, but this is much more beautiful!

L. Yes, for both the elements have true virtue in them; it is a pity they are at war, but they
war grandly.

MARY. But is this the same clay as in the other crystal?

L. I used the word clay for shortness. In both, the enemy is really limestone; but in the first,
disordered, and mixed with true clay; while, here, it is nearly pure, and crystallises into
its own primitive form, the oblique six-sided one, which you know: and out of these it makes
regiments; and then squares of the regiments, and so charges the rock crystal literally in
square against column.

ISABEL. Please, please, let me see. And what does the rock crystal do?

L. The rock crystal seems able to do nothing. The calcite cuts it through at every charge.
Look here,--and here! The loveliest crystal in the whole group is hewn fairly into two pieces.

ISABEL. Oh, dear; but is the calcite harder than the crystal then?

L. No, softer. Very much softer.

MARY. But then, how can it possibly cut the crystal?

L. It did not really cut it, though it passes through it. The two were formed together, as
I told you; but no one knows how. Still, it is strange that this hard quartz has in all cases
a good-natured way with it, of yielding to everything else. All sorts of soft things make nests
for themselves in it; and it never makes a nest for itself in anything. It has all the rough
outside work; and every sort of cowardly and weak mineral can shelter itself within it. Look;
these are hexagonal plates of mica; if they were outside of this crystal they would break,
like burnt paper; but they are inside of it,--nothing can hurt them,--the crystal has taken
them into its very heart, keeping all their delicate edges as sharp as if they were under water,
instead of bathed in rock. Here is a piece of branched silver: you can bend it with a touch
of your finger, but the stamp of its every fibre is on the rock in which it lay, as if the
quartz had been as soft as wool.

LILY. Oh, the good, good quartz! But does it never get inside of anything?

L. As it is a little Irish girl who asks, I may perhaps answer, without being laughed at, that
it gets inside of itself sometimes. But I don't remember seeing quartz make a nest for itself
in anything else.

ISABEL. Please, there was something I heard you talking about, last term, with Miss Mary. I
was at my lessons, but I heard something about nests; and I thought it was birds' nests; and
I couldn't help listening; and then, I remember, it was about 'nests of quartz in granite.'
I remember, because I was so disappointed!

L. Yes, mousie, you remember quite rightly; but I can't tell you about those nests to-day,
nor perhaps to-morrow: but there's no contradiction between my saying then, and now; I will
show you that there is not, some day. Will you trust me meanwhile?

ISABEL. Won't I!

L. Well, then, look, lastly, at this piece of courtesy in quartz; it is on a small scale, but
wonderfully pretty. Here is nobly born quartz living with a green mineral, called epidote;
and they are immense friends. Now, you see, a comparatively large and strong quartz-crystal,
and a very weak and slender little one of epidote, have begun to grow, close by each other,
and sloping unluckily towards each other, so that they at last meet. They cannot go on growing
together; the quartz crystal is five times as thick, and more than twenty times as strong,[151]
as the epidote; but he stops at once, just in the very crowning moment of his life, when he
is building his own summit! He lets the pale little film of epidote grow right past him; stopping
his own summit for it; and he never himself grows any more.

LILY (after some silence of wonder). But is the quartz never wicked then?

L. Yes, but the wickedest quartz seems good-natured, compared to other things. Here are two
very characteristic examples; one is good quartz, living with good pearlspar, and the other,
wicked quartz, living with wicked pearlspar. In both, the quartz yields to the soft carbonate
of iron: but, in the first place, the iron takes only what it needs of room; and is inserted
into the planes of the rock crystal with such precision, that you must break it away before
you can tell whether it really penetrates the quartz or not; while the crystals of iron are
perfectly formed, and have a lovely bloom on their surface besides. But here, when the two
minerals quarrel, the unhappy quartz has all its surfaces jagged and torn to pieces; and there
is not a single iron crystal whose shape you can completely trace. But the quartz has the worst
of it, in both instances.

VIOLET. Might we look at that piece of broken quartz again, with the weak little film across
it? it seems such a strange lovely thing, like the self-sacrifice of a human being.

L. The self-sacrifice of a human being is not a lovely thing, Violet. It is often a necessary
and noble thing; but no form nor degree of suicide can be ever lovely.

VIOLET. But self-sacrifice is not suicide!

L. What is it then?

VIOLET. Giving up one's self for another.

L. Well; and what do you mean by 'giving up one's self?'

VIOLET. Giving up one's tastes, one's feelings, one's time, one's happiness, and so on, to
make others happy.

L. I hope you will never marry anybody, Violet, who expects you to make him happy in that way.

VIOLET (hesitating). In what way?

L. By giving up your tastes, and sacrificing your feelings, and happiness.

VIOLET. No, no, I don't mean that; but you know, for other people, one must.

L. For people who don't love you, and whom you know nothing about? Be it so; but how does this
'giving up' differ from suicide then?

VIOLET. Why, giving up one's pleasures is not killing one's self?

L. Giving up wrong pleasure is not; neither is it self-sacrifice, but self-culture. But giving
up right pleasure is. If you surrender the pleasure of walking, your foot will wither; you
may as well cut it off: if you surrender the pleasure of seeing, your eyes will soon be unable
to bear the light; you may as well pluck them out. And to maim yourself is partly to kill yourself.
Do but go on maiming, and you will soon slay.

VIOLET. But why do you make me think of that verse then about the foot and the eye?

L. You are indeed commanded to cut off and to pluck out, if foot or eye offend you; but why
should they offend you?

VIOLET. I don't know; I never quite understood that.

L. Yet it is a sharp order; one needing to be well understood if it is to be well obeyed! When
Helen sprained her ancle the other day, you saw how strongly it had to be bandaged: that is
to say, prevented from all work, to recover it. But the bandage was not 'lovely.'

VIOLET. No, indeed.

L. And if her foot had been crushed, or diseased, or snake-bitten, instead of sprained, it
might have been needful to cut it off. But the amputation would not have been 'lovely.'

VIOLET. No.

L. Well, if eye and foot are dead already, and betray you--if the light that is in you be darkness,
and your feet run into mischief, or are taken in the snare,--it is indeed time to pluck out,
and cut off, I think: but, so crippled, you can never be what you might have been otherwise.
You enter into life, at best, halt or maimed; and the sacrifice is not beautiful, though necessary.

VIOLET (after a pause). But when one sacrifices one's self for others?

L. Why not rather others for you?

VIOLET. Oh! but I couldn't bear that.

L. Then why should they bear it?

DORA (bursting in, indignant). And Thermopylæ, and Protesilaus, and Marcus Curtius, and Arnold
de Winkelried, and Iphigenia, and Jephthah's daughter?

L. (sustaining the indignation unmoved). And the Samaritan woman's son?

DORA. Which Samaritan woman's?

L. Read 2 Kings vi. 29.

DORA (obeys). How horrid! As if we meant anything like that!

L. You don't seem to me to know in the least what you do mean, children. What practical difference
is there between 'that,' and what you are talking about? The Samaritan children had no voice
of their own in the business, it is true; but neither had Iphigenia: the Greek girl was certainly
neither boiled, nor eaten; but that only makes a difference in the dramatic effect; not in
the principle.

DORA (biting her lip). Well, then, tell us what we ought to mean. As if you didn't teach it
all to us, and mean it yourself, at this moment, more than we do, if you wouldn't be tiresome!

L. I mean, and have always meant, simply this, Dora;--that the will of God respecting us is
that we shall live by each other's happiness, and life; not by each other's misery, or death.
I made you read that verse which so shocked you just now, because the relations of parent and
child are typical of all beautiful human help. A child may have to die for its parents; but
the purpose of Heaven is that it shall rather live for them;--that, not by its sacrifice, but
by its strength, its joy, its force of being, it shall be to them renewal of strength; and
as the arrow in the hand of the giant. So it is in all other right relations. Men help each
other by their joy, not by their sorrow. They are not intended to slay themselves for each
other, but to strengthen themselves for each other. And among the many apparently beautiful
things which turn, through mistaken use, to utter evil, I am not sure but that the thoughtlessly
meek and self-sacrificing spirit of good men must be named as one of the fatallest. They have
so often been taught that there is a virtue in mere suffering, as such; and foolishly to hope
that good may be brought by Heaven out of all on which Heaven itself has set the stamp of evil,
that we may avoid it,--that they accept pain and defeat as if these were their appointed portion;
never understanding that their defeat is not the less to be mourned because it is more fatal
to their enemies than to them. The one thing that a good man has to do, and to see done, is
justice; he is neither to slay himself nor others causelessly: so far from denying himself,
since he is pleased by good, he is to do his utmost to get his pleasure accomplished. And I
only wish there were strength, fidelity, and sense enough, among the good Englishmen of this
day, to render it possible for them to band together in a vowed brotherhood, to enforce, by
strength of heart and hand, the doing of human justice among all who came within their sphere.
And finally, for your own teaching, observe, although there may be need for much self-sacrifice
and self-denial in the correction of faults of character, the moment the character is formed,
the self-denial ceases. Nothing is really well done, which it costs you pain to do.

VIOLET. But surely, sir, you are always pleased with us when we try to please others, and not
ourselves?

L. My dear child, in the daily course and discipline of right life, we must continually and
reciprocally submit and surrender in all kind and courteous and affectionate ways: and these
submissions and ministries to each other, of which you all know (none better) the practice
and the preciousness, are as good for the yielder as the receiver: they strengthen and perfect
as much as they soften and refine. But the real sacrifice of all our strength, or life, or
happiness to others (though it may be needed, and though all brave creatures hold their lives
in their hand, to be given, when such need comes, as frankly as a soldier gives his life in
battle), is yet always a mournful and momentary necessity; not the fulfilment of the continuous
law of being. Self-sacrifice which is sought after, and triumphed in, is usually foolish; and
calamitous in its issue: and by the sentimental proclamation and pursuit of it, good people
have not only made most of their own lives useless, but the whole framework of their religion
so hollow, that at this moment, while the English nation, with its lips, pretends to teach
every man to 'love his neighbour as himself,' with its hands and feet it clutches and tramples
like a wild beast; and practically lives, every soul of it that can, on other people's labour.
Briefly, the constant duty of every man to his fellows is to ascertain his own powers and special
gifts; and to strengthen them for the help of others. Do you think Titian would have helped
the world better by denying himself, and not painting; or Casella by denying himself, and not
singing? The real virtue is to be ready to sing the moment people ask us; as he was, even in
purgatory. The very word 'virtue' means not 'conduct' but 'strength,' vital energy in the heart.
Were not you reading about that group of words beginning with V,--vital, virtuous, vigorous,
and so on,--in Max Muller, the other day, Sibyl? Can't you tell the others about it?

SIBYL. No, I can't; will you tell us, please?

L. Not now, it is too late. Come to me some idle time to-morrow, and I'll tell you about it,
if all's well. But the gist of it is, children, that you should at least know two Latin words;
recollect that 'mors' means death and delaying; and 'vita' means life and growing: and try
always, not to mortify yourselves, but to vivify yourselves.

VIOLET. But, then, are we not to mortify our earthly affections? and surely we are to sacrifice
ourselves, at least in God's service, if not in man's?

L. Really, Violet, we are getting too serious. I've given you enough ethics for one talk, I
think! Do let us have a little play. Lily, what were you so busy about, at the ant-hill in
the wood, this morning?

LILY. Oh, it was the ants who were busy, not I; I was only trying to help them a little.

L. And they wouldn't be helped, I suppose?

LILY. No, indeed. I can't think why ants are always so tiresome, when one tries to help them!
They were carrying bits of stick, as fast as they could, through a piece of grass; and pulling
and pushing, so hard; and tumbling over and over,--it made one quite pity them; so I took some
of the bits of stick, and carried them forward a little, where I thought they wanted to put
them; but instead of being pleased, they left them directly, and ran about looking quite angry
and frightened; and at last ever so many of them got up my sleeves, and bit me all over, and
I had to come away.

L. I couldn't think what you were about. I saw your French grammar lying on the grass behind
you, and thought perhaps you had gone to ask the ants to hear you a French verb.

ISABEL. Ah! but you didn't, though!

L. Why not, Isabel? I knew, well enough, Lily couldn't learn that verb by herself.

ISABEL. No; but the ants couldn't help her.

L. Are you sure the ants could not have helped you, Lily?

LILY (thinking). I ought to have learned something from them, perhaps.

L. But none of them left their sticks to help you through the irregular verb?

LILY. No, indeed. (Laughing, with some others.)

L. What are you laughing at, children? I cannot see why the ants should not have left their
tasks to help Lily in her's,--since here is Violet thinking she ought to leave her tasks, to
help God in His. Perhaps, however, she takes Lily's more modest view, and thinks only that
'He ought to learn something from her.'

     (Tears in VIOLET'S eyes.)

DORA (scarlet). It's too bad--it's a shame:--poor Violet!

L. My dear children, there's no reason why one should be so red, and the other so pale, merely
because you are made for a moment to feel the absurdity of a phrase which you have been taught
to use, in common with half the religious world. There is but one way in which man can ever
help God--that is, by letting God help him: and there is no way in which his name is more guiltily
taken in vain, than by calling the abandonment of our own work, the performance of His.

God is a kind Father. He sets us all in the places where He wishes us to be employed; and that
employment is truly 'our Father's business.' He chooses work for every creature which will
be delightful to them, if they do it simply and humbly. He gives us always strength enough,
and sense enough, for what He wants us to do; if we either tire ourselves or puzzle ourselves,
it is our own fault. And we may always be sure, whatever we are doing, that we cannot be pleasing
Him, if we are not happy ourselves. Now, away with you, children; and be as happy as you can.
And when you cannot, at least don't plume yourselves upon pouting.

LECTURE VII.

HOME VIRTUES.

     By the fireside, in the Drawing-room. Evening.

DORA. Now, the curtains are drawn, and the fire's bright and here's your arm-chair--and you're
to tell us all about what you promised.

L. All about what?

DORA. All about virtue.

KATHLEEN. Yes, and about the words that begin with V.

L. I heard you singing about a word that begins with V, in the playground, this morning, Miss
Katie.

KATHLEEN. Me singing?

MAY. Oh tell us--tell us.

L. 'Vilikens and his----'

KATHLEEN (stopping his mouth). Oh! please don't. Where were you?

ISABEL. I'm sure I wish I had known where he was! We lost him among the rhododendrons, and
I don't know where he got to; oh, you naughty--naughty--(climbs on his knee).

DORA. Now, Isabel, we really want to talk.

L. I don't.

DORA. Oh, but you must. You promised, you know.

L. Yes, if all was well; but all's ill. I'm tired, and cross; and I won't.

DORA. You're not a bit tired, and you're not crosser than two sticks; and we'll make you talk,
if you were crosser than six. Come here, Egypt; and get on the other side of him.

     (EGYPT takes up a commanding position near the
     hearth-brush.)

DORA (reviewing her forces). Now, Lily, come and sit on the rug in front.

     (LILY does as she is bid.)

L. (seeing he has no chance against the odds.) Well, well; but I'm really tired. Go and dance
a little, first; and let me think.

DORA. No; you mustn't think. You will be wanting to make us think next; that will be tiresome.

L. Well, go and dance first, to get quit of thinking; and then I'll talk as long as you like.

DORA. Oh, but we can't dance to-night. There isn't time; and we want to hear about virtue.

L. Let me see a little of it first. Dancing is the first of girl's virtues.

EGYPT. Indeed! And the second?

L. Dressing.

EGYPT. Now, you needn't say that! I mended that tear the first thing before breakfast this morning.

L. I cannot otherwise express the ethical principle, Egypt; whether you have mended your gown
or not.

DORA. Now don't be tiresome. We really must hear about virtue, please; seriously.

L. Well. I'm telling you about it, as fast as I can.

DORA. What! the first of girls' virtues is dancing?

L. More accurately, it is wishing to dance, and not wishing to tease, nor hear about virtue.

DORA (to EGYPT). Isn't he cross?

EGYPT. How many balls must we go to in the season, to be perfectly virtuous?

L. As many as you can without losing your colour. But I did not say you should wish to go to
balls. I said you should be always wanting to dance.

EGYPT. So we do; but everybody says it is very wrong.

L. Why, Egypt, I thought--

    'There was a lady once,
    That would not be a queen,--that would she not,
    For all the mud in Egypt.'

You were complaining the other day of having to go out a great deal oftener than you liked.

EGYPT. Yes, so I was; but then, it isn't to dance. There's no room to dance: it's--(Pausing
to consider what it is for).

L. It is only to be seen, I suppose. Well, there's no harm in that. Girls ought to like to be seen.

DORA (her eyes flashing). Now, you don't mean that; and you're too provoking; and we won't
dance again, for a month.

L. It will answer every purpose of revenge, Dora, if you only banish me to the library; and
dance by yourselves: but I don't think Jessie and Lily will agree to that. You like me to see
you dancing, don't you Lily?

LILY. Yes, certainly,--when we do it rightly.

L. And besides, Miss Dora, if young ladies really do not want to be seen, they should take
care not to let their eyes flash when they dislike what people say; and, more than that, it
is all nonsense from beginning to end, about not wanting to be seen. I don't know any more
tiresome flower in the borders than your especially 'modest' snowdrop; which one always has
to stoop down and take all sorts of tiresome trouble with, and nearly break its poor little
head off, before you can see it; and then, half of it is not worth seeing. Girls should be
like daisies; nice and white, with an edge of red, if you look close; making the ground bright
wherever they are; knowing simply and quietly that they do it, and are meant to do it, and
that it would be very wrong if they didn't do it. Not want to be seen, indeed! How long were
you in doing your back hair, this afternoon, Jessie?

     (JESSIE not immediately answering, DORA comes to her
     assistance.)

DORA. Not above three-quarters of an hour, I think, Jess?

JESSIE (putting her finger up). Now, Dorothy, you needn't talk, you know!

L. I know she needn't, Jessie; I shall ask her about those dark plaits presently. (DORA looks
round to see if there is any way open for retreat.) But never mind; it was worth the time,
whatever it was; and nobody will ever mistake that golden wreath for a chignon; but if you
don't want it to be seen, you had better wear a cap.

JESSIE. Ah, now, are you really going to do nothing but play? And we all have been thinking,
and thinking, all day; and hoping you would tell us things; and now--!

L. And now I am telling you things, and true things, and things good for you; and you won't
believe me. You might as well have let me go to sleep at once, as I wanted to.

     (Endeavours again to make himself comfortable.)

ISABEL. Oh, no, no, you sha'n't go to sleep, you naughty--Kathleen, come here.

L. (knowing what he has to expect if KATHLEEN comes). Get away, Isabel, you're too heavy. (Sitting
up.) What have I been saying?

DORA. I do believe he has been asleep all the time! You never heard anything like the things
you've been saying.

L. Perhaps not. If you have heard them, and anything like them, it is all I want.

EGYPT. Yes, but we don't understand, and you know we don't; and we want to.

L. What did I say first?

DORA. That the first virtue of girls was wanting to go to balls.

L. I said nothing of the kind.

JESSIE. 'Always wanting to dance,' you said.

L. Yes, and that's true. Their first virtue is to be intensely happy;--so happy that they don't
know what to do with themselves for happiness,--and dance, instead of walking. Don't you recollect
'Louisa,'

    'No fountain from a rocky cave
      E'er tripped with foot so free;
    She seemed as happy as a wave
      That dances on the sea.'

A girl is always like that, when everything's right with her.

VIOLET. But, surely, one must be sad sometimes?

L. Yes, Violet; and dull sometimes, and stupid sometimes, and cross sometimes. What must be,
must; but it is always either our own fault, or somebody else's. The last and worst thing that
can be said of a nation is, that it has made its young girls sad, and weary.

MAY. But I am sure I have heard a great many good people speak against dancing?

L. Yes, May; but it does not follow they were wise as well as good. They understand now: but,
do you know what you said next?

L. Yes; I was not more than half asleep. I said their second virtue was dressing.

MARY. Well! what did you mean by that?

L. What do you mean by dressing?

MARY. Wearing fine clothes.

L. Ah! there's the mistake. I mean wearing plain ones.

MARY. Yes, I daresay! but that's not what girls understand by dressing, you know.

L. I can't help that. If they understand by dressing, buying dresses, perhaps they also understand
by drawing, buying pictures. But when I hear them say they can draw, I understand that they
can make a drawing; and when I hear them say they can dress, I understand that they can make
a dress and--which is quite as difficult--wear one.

DORA. I'm not sure about the making; for the wearing, we can all wear them--out, before anybody
expects it.

EGYPT (aside, to L., piteously). Indeed I have mended that torn flounce quite neatly; look
if I haven't!

L. (aside, to EGYPT). All right; don't be afraid. (Aloud to DORA.) Yes, doubtless; but you
know that is only a slow way of undressing.

DORA. Then, we are all to learn dress-making, are we?

L. Yes; and always to dress yourselves beautifully--not finely, unless on occasion; but then
very finely and beautifully too. Also, you are to dress as many other people as you can; and
to teach them how to dress, if they don't know; and to consider every ill-dressed woman or
child whom you see anywhere, as a personal disgrace; and to get at them, somehow, until everybody
is as beautifully dressed as birds.

     (Silence; the children drawing their breaths hard, as if
     they had come from under a shower bath.)

L (seeing objections begin to express themselves in the eyes). Now you needn't say you can't;
for you can: and it's what you were meant to do, always; and to dress your houses, and your
gardens, too; and to do very little else, I believe, except singing; and dancing, as we said,
of course; and--one thing more.

DORA. Our third and last virtue, I suppose?

L. Yes; on Violet's system of triplicities.

DORA. Well, we are prepared for anything now. What is it?

L. Cooking.

DORA. Cardinal, indeed! If only Beatrice were here with her seven handmaids, that she might
see what a fine eighth we had found for her!

MARY. And the interpretation? What does 'cooking' mean?

L. It means the knowledge of Medea, and of Circe, and of Calypso, and of Helen, and of Rebekah,
and of the Queen of Sheba. It means the knowledge of all herbs, and fruits, and balms, and
spices; and of all that is healing and sweet in fields and groves, and savoury in meats; it
means carefulness, and inventiveness, and watchfulness, and willingness, and readiness of appliance;
it means the economy of your great-grandmothers, and the science of modern chemists; it means
much tasting, and no wasting; it means English thoroughness, and French art, and Arabian hospitality;
and it means, in fine, that you are to be perfectly and always 'ladies'--'loaf-givers;' and,
as you are to see, imperatively that everybody has something pretty to put on,--so you are
to see, yet more imperatively, that everybody has something nice to eat.

     (Another pause, and long drawn breath.)

DORA (slowly recovering herself) to EGYPT. We had better have let him go to sleep, I think,
after all!

L. You had better let the younger ones go to sleep now: for I haven't half done.

ISABEL (panic-struck). Oh! please, please! just one quarter of an hour.

L. No, Isabel; I cannot say what I've got to say, in a quarter of an hour; and it is too hard
for you, besides:--you would be lying awake, and trying to make it out, half the night. That
will never do.

ISABEL. Oh, please!

L. It would please me exceedingly, mousie: but there are times when we must both be displeased;
more's the pity. Lily may stay for half an hour, if she likes.

LILY. I can't; because Isey never goes to sleep, if she is waiting for me to come.

ISABEL. Oh, yes, Lily; I'll go to sleep to-night, I will, indeed.

LILY. Yes, it's very likely, Isey, with those fine round eyes! (To L.) You'll tell me something
of what you've been saying, to-morrow, won't you?

L. No, I won't, Lily. You must choose. It's only in Miss Edgeworth's novels that one can do
right, and have one's cake and sugar afterwards, as well (not that I consider the dilemma,
to-night, so grave).

     (LILY, sighing, takes ISABEL's hand.)

Yes, Lily dear, it will be better, in the outcome of it, so, than if you were to hear all the
talks that ever were talked, and all the stories that ever were told. Good night.

     (The door leading to the condemned cells of the Dormitory
     closes on LILY, ISABEL, FLORRIE, and other diminutive and
     submissive victims.)

JESSIE (after a pause). Why, I thought you were so fond of Miss Edgeworth!

L. So I am; and so you ought all to be. I can read her over and over again, without ever tiring;
there's no one whose every page is so full, and so delightful; no one who brings you into the
company of pleasanter or wiser people; no one who tells you more truly how to do right. And
it is very nice, in the midst of a wild world, to have the very ideal of poetical justice done
always to one's hand:--to have everybody found out, who tells lies; and everybody decorated
with a red riband, who doesn't; and to see the good Laura, who gave away her half sovereign,
receiving a grand ovation from an entire dinner party disturbed for the purpose; and poor,
dear, little Rosamond, who chooses purple jars instead of new shoes, left at last without either
her shoes or her bottle. But it isn't life: and, in the way children might easily understand
it, it isn't morals.

JESSIE. How do you mean we might understand it?

L. You might think Miss Edgeworth meant that the right was to be done mainly because one was
always rewarded for doing it. It is an injustice to her to say that: her heroines always do
right simply for its own sake, as they should; and her examples of conduct and motive are wholly
admirable. But her representation of events is false and misleading. Her good characters never
are brought into the deadly trial of goodness,--the doing right, and suffering for it, quite
finally. And that is life, as God arranges it. 'Taking up one's cross' does not at all mean
having ovations at dinner parties, and being put over everybody else's head.

DORA. But what does it mean then? That is just what we couldn't understand, when you were telling
us about not sacrificing ourselves, yesterday.

L. My dear, it means simply that you are to go the road which you see to be the straight one;
carrying whatever you find is given you to carry, as well and stoutly as you can; without making
faces, or calling people to come and look at you. Above all, you are neither to load, nor unload,
yourself; nor cut your cross to your own liking. Some people think it would be better for them
to have it large; and many, that they could carry it much faster if it were small; and even
those who like it largest are usually very particular about its being ornamental, and made
of the best ebony. But all that you have really to do is to keep your back as straight as you
can; and not think about what is upon it--above all, not to boast of what is upon it. The real
and essential meaning of 'virtue' is in that straightness of back. Yes; you may laugh, children,
but it is. You know I was to tell about the words that began with V. Sibyl, what does 'virtue'
mean, literally?

SIBYL. Does it mean courage?

L. Yes; but a particular kind of courage. It means courage of the nerve; vital courage. That
first syllable of it, if you look in Max Müller, you will find really means 'nerve,' and from
it come 'vis,' and 'vir,' and 'virgin' (through vireo), and the connected word 'virga'--'a
rod;'--the green rod, or springing bough of a tree, being the type of perfect human strength,
both in the use of it in the Mosaic story, when it becomes a serpent, or strikes the rock;
or when Aaron's bears its almonds; and in the metaphorical expressions, the 'Rod out of the
stem of Jesse,' and the 'Man whose name is the Branch,' and so on. And the essential idea of
real virtue is that of a vital human strength, which instinctively, constantly, and without
motive, does what is right. You must train men to this by habit, as you would the branch of
a tree; and give them instincts and manners (or morals) of purity, justice, kindness, and courage.
Once rightly trained, they act as they should, irrespectively of all motive, of fear, or of
reward. It is the blackest sign of putrescence in a national religion, when men speak as if
it were the only safeguard of conduct; and assume that, but for the fear of being burned, or
for the hope of being rewarded, everybody would pass their lives in lying, stealing, and murdering.
I think quite one of the notablest historical events of this century (perhaps the very notablest),
was that council of clergymen, horror-struck at the idea of any diminution in our dread of
hell, at which the last of English clergymen whom one would have expected to see in such a
function, rose as the devil's advocate; to tell us how impossible it was we could get on without
him.

VIOLET (after a pause). But, surely, if people weren't afraid--(hesitates again).

L. They should be afraid of doing wrong, and of that only, my dear. Otherwise, if they only
don't do wrong for fear of being punished, they have done wrong in their hearts, already.

VIOLET. Well, but surely, at least one ought to be afraid of displeasing God; and one's desire
to please Him should be one's first motive?

L. He never would be pleased with us, if it were, my dear. When a father sends his son out
into the world--suppose as an apprentice--fancy the boy's coming home at night, and saying,
'Father, I could have robbed the till to-day; but I didn't, because I thought you wouldn't
like it.' Do you think the father would be particularly pleased?

     (VIOLET is silent.)

He would answer, would he not, if he were wise and good, 'My boy, though you had no father,
you must not rob tills'? And nothing is ever done so as really to please our Great Father,
unless we would also have done it, though we had had no Father to know of it.

VIOLET (after long pause). But, then, what continual threatenings, and promises of reward there
are!

L. And how vain both! with the Jews, and with all of us. But the fact is, that the threat and
promise are simply statements of the Divine law, and of its consequences. The fact is truly
told you,--make what use you may of it: and as collateral warning, or encouragement, or comfort,
the knowledge of future consequences may often be helpful to us; but helpful chiefly to the
better state when we can act without reference to them. And there's no measuring the poisoned
influence of that notion of future reward on the mind of Christian Europe, in the early ages.
Half the monastic system rose out of that, acting on the occult pride and ambition of good
people (as the other half of it came of their follies and misfortunes). There is always a considerable
quantity of pride, to begin with, in what is called 'giving one's self to God.' As if one had
ever belonged to anybody else!

DORA. But, surely, great good has come out of the monastic system--our books,--our sciences--all
saved by the monks?

L. Saved from what, my dear? From the abyss of misery and ruin which that false Christianity
allowed the whole active world to live in. When it had become the principal amusement, and
the most admired art, of Christian men, to cut one another's throats, and burn one another's
towns; of course the few feeble or reasonable persons left, who desired quiet, safety, and
kind fellowship, got into cloisters; and the gentlest, thoughtfullest, noblest men and women
shut themselves up, precisely where they could be of least use. They are very fine things,
for us painters, now,--the towers and white arches upon the tops of the rocks; always in places
where it takes a day's climbing to get at them; but the intense tragi-comedy of the thing,
when one thinks of it, is unspeakable. All the good people of the world getting themselves
hung up out of the way of mischief, like Bailie Nicol Jarvie;--poor little lambs, as it were,
dangling there for the sign of the Golden Fleece; or like Socrates in his basket in the 'Clouds'!
(I must read you that bit of Aristophanes again, by the way.) And believe me, children, I am
no warped witness, as far as regards monasteries; or if I am, it is in their favour. I have
always had a strong leaning that way; and have pensively shivered with Augustines at St. Bernard;
and happily made hay with Franciscans at Fesolé; and sat silent with Carthusians in their little
gardens, south of Florence; and mourned through many a day-dream, at Melrose and Bolton. But
the wonder is always to me, not how much, but how little, the monks have, on the whole, done,
with all that leisure, and all that goodwill! What nonsense monks characteristically wrote;--what
little progress they made in the sciences to which they devoted themselves as a duty,--medicine
especially;--and, last and worst, what depths of degradation they can sometimes see one another,
and the population round them, sink into; without either doubting their system, or reforming it!

(Seeing questions rising to lips.) Hold your little tongues, children; it's very late, and
you'll make me forget what I've to say. Fancy yourselves in pews, for five minutes. There's
one point of possible good in the conventual system, which is always attractive to young girls;
and the idea is a very dangerous one;--the notion of a merit, or exalting virtue, consisting
in a habit of meditation on the 'things above,' or things of the next world. Now it is quite
true, that a person of beautiful mind, dwelling on whatever appears to them most desirable
and lovely in a possible future will not only pass their time pleasantly, but will even acquire,
at last, a vague and wildly gentle charm of manner and feature, which will give them an air
of peculiar sanctity in the eyes of others. Whatever real or apparent good there may be in
this result, I want you to observe, children, that we have no real authority for the reveries
to which it is owing. We are told nothing distinctly of the heavenly world; except that it
will be free from sorrow, and pure from sin. What is said of pearl gates, golden floors, and
the like, is accepted as merely figurative by religious enthusiasts themselves; and whatever
they pass their time in conceiving, whether of the happiness of risen souls, of their intercourse,
or of the appearance and employment of the heavenly powers, is entirely the product of their
own imagination; and as completely and distinctly a work of fiction, or romantic invention,
as any novel of Sir Walter Scott's. That the romance is founded on religious theory or doctrine;--that
no disagreeable or wicked persons are admitted into the story;--and that the inventor fervently
hopes that some portion of it may hereafter come true, does not in the least alter the real
nature of the effort or enjoyment.

Now, whatever indulgence may be granted to amiable people for pleasing themselves in this innocent
way, it is beyond question, that to seclude themselves from the rough duties of life, merely
to write religious romances, or, as in most cases, merely to dream them, without taking so
much trouble as is implied in writing, ought not to be received as an act of heroic virtue.
But, observe, even in admitting thus much, I have assumed that the fancies are just and beautiful,
though fictitious. Now, what right have any of us to assume that our own fancies will assuredly
be either the one or the other? That they delight us, and appear lovely to us, is no real proof
of its not being wasted time to form them: and we may surely be led somewhat to distrust our
judgment of them by observing what ignoble imaginations have sometimes sufficiently, or even
enthusiastically, occupied the hearts of others. The principal source of the spirit of religious
contemplation is the East; now I have here in my hand a Byzantine image of Christ, which, if
you will look at it seriously, may, I think, at once and for ever render you cautious in the
indulgence of a merely contemplative habit of mind. Observe, it is the fashion to look at such
a thing only as a piece of barbarous art; that is the smallest part of its interest. What I
want you to see, is the baseness and falseness of a religious state of enthusiasm, in which
such a work could be dwelt upon with pious pleasure. That a figure, with two small round black
beads for eyes; a gilded face, deep cut into horrible wrinkles; an open gash for a mouth, and
a distorted skeleton for a body, wrapped about, to make it fine, with striped enamel of blue
and gold;--that such a figure, I say, should ever have been thought helpful towards the conception
of a Redeeming Deity, may make you, I think, very doubtful, even of the Divine approval,--much
more of the Divine inspiration,--of religious reverie in general. You feel, doubtless, that
your own idea of Christ would be something very different from this; but in what does the difference
consist? Not in any more divine authority in your imagination; but in the intellectual work
of six intervening centuries; which, simply, by artistic discipline, has refined this crude
conception for you, and filled you, partly with an innate sensation, partly with an acquired
knowledge, of higher forms,--which render this Byzantine crucifix as horrible to you, as it
was pleasing to its maker. More is required to excite your fancy; but your fancy is of no more
authority than his was: and a point of national art-skill is quite conceivable, in which the
best we can do now will be as offensive to the religious dreamers of the more highly cultivated
time, as this Byzantine crucifix is to you.

MARY. But surely, Angelico will always retain his power over everybody?

L. Yes, I should think, always; as the gentle words of a child will: but you would be much
surprised, Mary, if you thoroughly took the pains to analyse, and had the perfect means of
analysing, that power of Angelico,--to discover its real sources. Of course it is natural,
at first, to attribute it to the pure religious fervour by which he was inspired; but do you
suppose Angelico was really the only monk, in all the Christian world of the middle ages, who
laboured, in art, with a sincere religious enthusiasm?

MARY. No, certainly not.

L. Anything more frightful, more destructive of all religious faith whatever, than such a supposition,
could not be. And yet, what other monk ever produced such work? I have myself examined carefully
upwards of two thousand illuminated missals, with especial view to the discovery of any evidence
of a similar result upon the art, from the monkish devotion; and utterly in vain.

MARY. But then, was not Fra Angelico a man of entirely separate and exalted genius?

L. Unquestionably; and granting him to be that, the peculiar phenomenon in his art is, to me,
not its loveliness, but its weakness. The effect of 'inspiration,' had it been real, on a man
of consummate genius, should have been, one would have thought, to make everything that he
did faultless and strong, no less than lovely. But of all men, deserving to be called 'great,'
Fra Angelico permits to himself the least pardonable faults, and the most palpable follies.
There is evidently within him a sense of grace, and power of invention, as great as Ghiberti's:--we
are in the habit of attributing those high qualities to his religious enthusiasm; but, if they
were produced by that enthusiasm in him, they ought to be produced by the same feelings in
others; and we see they are not. Whereas, comparing him with contemporary great artists, of
equal grace and invention, one peculiar character remains notable in him--which, logically,
we ought therefore to attribute to the religious fervour;--and that distinctive character is,
the contented indulgence of his own weaknesses, and perseverance in his own ignorances.

MARY. But that's dreadful! And what is the source of the peculiar charm which we all feel in
his work?

L. There are many sources of it, Mary; united and seeming like one. You would never feel that
charm but in the work of an entirely good man; be sure of that; but the goodness is only the
recipient and modifying element, not the creative one. Consider carefully what delights you
in any original picture of Angelico's. You will find, for one minor thing, an exquisite variety
and brightness of ornamental work. That is not Angelico's inspiration. It is the final result
of the labour and thought of millions of artists, of all nations; from the earliest Egyptian
potters downwards--Greeks, Byzantines, Hindoos, Arabs, Gauls, and Northmen--all joining in
the toil; and consummating it in Florence, in that century, with such embroidery of robe and
inlaying of armour as had never been seen till then; nor, probably, ever will be seen more.
Angelico merely takes his share of this inheritance, and applies it in the tenderest way to
subjects which are peculiarly acceptant of it. But the inspiration, if it exist anywhere, flashes
on the knight's shield quite as radiantly as on the monk's picture. Examining farther into
the sources of your emotion in the Angelico work, you will find much of the impression of sanctity
dependent on a singular repose and grace of gesture, consummating itself in the floating, flying,
and above all, in the dancing groups. That is not Angelico's inspiration. It is only a peculiarly
tender use of systems of grouping which had been long before developed by Giotto, Memmi, and
Orcagna; and the real root of it all is simply--What do you think, children? The beautiful
dancing of the Florentine maidens!

DORA (indignant again). Now, I wonder what next! Why not say it all depended on Herodias' daughter,
at once?

L. Yes; it is certainly a great argument against singing, that there were once sirens.

DORA. Well, it may be all very fine and philosophical, but shouldn't I just like to read you
the end of the second volume of 'Modern Painters'!

L. My dear, do you think any teacher could be worth your listening to, or anybody else's listening
to, who had learned nothing, and altered his mind in nothing, from seven and twenty to seven
and forty? But that second volume is very good for you as far as it goes. It is a great advance,
and a thoroughly straight and swift one, to be led, as it is the main business of that second
volume to lead you, from Dutch cattle pieces, and ruffian-pieces, to Fra Angelico. And it is
right for you also, as you grow older, to be strengthened in the general sense and judgment
which may enable you to distinguish the weaknesses from the virtues of what you love: else
you might come to love both alike; or even the weaknesses without the virtues. You might end
by liking Overbeck and Cornelius as well as Angelico. However, I have perhaps been leaning
a little too much to the merely practical side of things, in to-night's talk; and you are always
to remember, children, that I do not deny, though I cannot affirm, the spiritual advantages
resulting, in certain cases, from enthusiastic religious reverie, and from the other practices
of saints and anchorites. The evidence respecting them has never yet been honestly collected,
much less dispassionately examined: but assuredly, there is in that direction a probability,
and more than a probability, of dangerous error, while there is none whatever in the practice
of an active, cheerful, and benevolent life. The hope of attaining a higher religious position,
which induces us to encounter, for its exalted alternative, the risk of unhealthy error, is
often, as I said, founded more on pride than piety; and those who, in modest usefulness, have
accepted what seemed to them here the lowliest place in the kingdom of their Father, are not,
I believe, the least likely to receive hereafter the command, then unmistakable, 'Friend, go
up higher.'

LECTURE VIII.

CRYSTAL CAPRICE.

Formal Lecture in Schoolroom, after some practical examination of minerals.

L. We have seen enough, children, though very little of what might be seen if we had more time,
of mineral structures produced by visible opposition, or contest among elements; structures
of which the variety, however great, need not surprise us: for we quarrel, ourselves, for many
and slight causes;--much more, one should think, may crystals, who can only feel the antagonism,
not argue about it. But there is a yet more singular mimicry of our human ways in the varieties
of form which appear owing to no antagonistic force; but merely to the variable humour and
caprice of the crystals themselves: and I have asked you all to come into the schoolroom to-day,
because, of course, this is a part of the crystal mind which must be peculiarly interesting
to a feminine audience. (Great symptoms of disapproval on the part of said audience.) Now,
you need not pretend that it will not interest you; why should it not? It is true that we men
are never capricious; but that only makes us the more dull and disagreeable. You, who are crystalline
in brightness, as well as in caprice, charm infinitely, by infinitude of change. (Audible murmurs
of 'Worse and worse!' 'As if we could be got over that way!' &c. The LECTURER, however, observing
the expression of the features to be more complacent, proceeds.) And the most curious mimicry,
if not of your changes of fashion, at least of your various modes (in healthy periods) of national
costume, takes place among the crystals of different countries. With a little experience, it
is quite possible to say at a glance, in what districts certain crystals have been found; and
although, if we had knowledge extended and accurate enough, we might of course ascertain the
laws and circumstances which have necessarily produced the form peculiar to each locality,
this would be just as true of the fancies of the human mind. If we could know the exact circumstances
which affect it, we could foretell what now seems to us only caprice of thought, as well as
what now seems to us only caprice of crystal: nay, so far as our knowledge reaches, it is on
the whole easier to find some reason why the peasant girls of Berne should wear their caps
in the shape of butterflies; and the peasant girls of Munich their's in the shape of shells,
than to say why the rock-crystals of Dauphiné should all have their summits of the shape of
lip-pieces of flageolets, while those of St. Gothard are symmetrical; or why the fluor of Chamouni
is rose-coloured, and in octahedrons, while the fluor of Weardale is green, and in cubes. Still
farther removed is the hope, at present, of accounting for minor differences in modes of grouping
and construction. Take, for instance, the caprices of this single mineral, quartz;--variations
upon a single theme. It has many forms; but see what it will make out of this one, the six-sided
prism. For shortness' sake, I shall call the body of the prism its 'column,' and the pyramid
at the extremities its 'cap.' Now, here, first you have a straight column, as long and thin
as a stalk of asparagus, with two little caps at the ends; and here you have a short thick
column, as solid as a haystack, with two fat caps at the ends; and here you have two caps fastened
together, and no column at all between them! Then here is a crystal with its column fat in
the middle, and tapering to a little cap; and here is one stalked like a mushroom, with a huge
cap put on the top of a slender column! Then here is a column built wholly out of little caps,
with a large smooth cap at the top. And here is a column built of columns and caps; the caps
all truncated about half way to their points. And in both these last, the little crystals are
set anyhow, and build the large one in a disorderly way; but here is a crystal made of columns
and truncated caps, set in regular terraces all the way up.

MARY. But are not these, groups of crystals, rather than one crystal?

L. What do you mean by a group, and what by one crystal?

DORA (audibly aside, to MARY, who is brought to pause). You know you are never expected to
answer, Mary.

L. I'm sure this is easy enough. What do you mean by a group of people?

MARY. Three or four together, or a good many together, like the caps in these crystals.

L. But when a great many persons get together they don't take the shape of one person?

     (MARY still at pause.)

ISABEL. No, because they can't; but, you know the crystals can; so why shouldn't they?

L. Well, they don't; that is to say, they don't always, nor even often. Look here, Isabel.

ISABEL. What a nasty ugly thing!

L. I'm glad you think it so ugly. Yet it is made of beautiful crystals; they are a little grey
and cold in colour, but most of them are clear.

ISABEL. But they're in such horrid, horrid disorder!

L. Yes; all disorder is horrid, when it is among things that are naturally orderly. Some little
girl's rooms are naturally disorderly, I suppose; or I don't know how they could live in them,
if they cry out so when they only see quartz crystals in confusion.

ISABEL. Oh! but how come they to be like that?

L. You may well ask. And yet you will always hear people talking as if they thought order more
wonderful than disorder! It is wonderful--as we have seen; but to me, as to you, child, the
supremely wonderful thing is that nature should ever be ruinous or wasteful, or deathful! I
look at this wild piece of crystallisation with endless astonishment.

MARY. Where does it come from?

L. The Tête Noire of Chamonix. What makes it more strange is that it should be in a vein of
fine quartz rock. If it were in a mouldering rock, it would be natural enough; but in the midst
of so fine substance, here are the crystals tossed in a heap; some large, myriads small (almost
as small as dust), tumbling over each other like a terrified crowd, and glued together by the
sides, and edges, and backs, and heads; some warped, and some pushed out and in, and all spoiled
and each spoiling the rest.

MARY. And how flat they all are!

L. Yes; that's the fashion at the Tête Noire.

MARY. But surely this is ruin, not caprice?

L. I believe it is in great part misfortune; and we will examine these crystal troubles in
next lecture. But if you want to see the gracefullest and happiest caprices of which dust is
capable, you must go to the Hartz; not that I ever mean to go there myself, for I want to retain
the romantic feeling about the name; and I have done myself some harm already by seeing the
monotonous and heavy form of the Brocken from the suburbs of Brunswick. But whether the mountains
be picturesque or not, the tricks which the goblins (as I am told) teach the crystals in them,
are incomparably pretty. They work chiefly on the mind of a docile, bluish coloured, carbonate
of lime; which comes out of a grey limestone. The goblins take the greatest possible care of
its education, and see that nothing happens to it to hurt its temper; and when it may be supposed
to have arrived at the crisis which is, to a well brought up mineral, what presentation at
court is to a young lady--after which it is expected to set fashions--there's no end to its
pretty ways of behaving. First it will make itself into pointed darts as fine as hoar-frost;
here, it is changed into a white fur as fine as silk; here into little crowns and circlets,
as bright as silver; as if for the gnome princesses to wear; here it is in beautiful little
plates, for them to eat off; presently it is in towers which they might be imprisoned in; presently
in caves and cells, where they may make nun-gnomes of themselves, and no gnome ever hear of
them more; here is some of it in sheaves, like corn; here, some in drifts, like snow; here,
some in rays, like stars: and, though these are, all of them, necessarily, shapes that the
mineral takes in other places, they are all taken here with such a grace that you recognise
the high caste and breeding of the crystals wherever you meet them; and know at once they are
Hartz-born.

Of course, such fine things as these are only done by crystals which are perfectly good, and
good-humoured; and of course, also, there are ill-humoured crystals who torment each other,
and annoy quieter crystals, yet without coming to anything like serious war. Here (for once)
is some ill-disposed quartz, tormenting a peaceable octahedron of fluor, in mere caprice. I
looked at it the other night so long, and so wonderingly, just before putting my candle out,
that I fell into another strange dream. But you don't care about dreams.

DORA. No; we didn't, yesterday; but you know we are made up of caprice; so we do, to-day: and
you must tell it us directly.

L. Well, you see, Neith and her work were still much in my mind; and then, I had been looking
over these Hartz things for you, and thinking of the sort of grotesque sympathy there seemed
to be in them with the beautiful fringe and pinnacle work of Northern architecture. So, when
I fell asleep, I thought I saw Neith and St. Barbara talking together.

DORA. But what had St. Barbara to do with it?[152]

L. My dear, I am quite sure St. Barbara is the patroness of good architects: not St. Thomas,
whatever the old builders thought. It might be very fine, according to the monks' notions,
in St. Thomas, to give all his employer's money away to the poor: but breaches of contract
are bad foundations; and I believe, it was not he, but St. Barbara, who overlooked the work
in all the buildings you and I care about. However that may be, it was certainly she whom I
saw in my dream with Neith. Neith was sitting weaving, and I thought she looked sad, and threw
her shuttle slowly; and St. Barbara was standing at her side, in a stiff little gown, all ins
and outs, and angles; but so bright with embroidery that it dazzled me whenever she moved;
the train of it was just like a heap of broken jewels, it was so stiff, and full of corners,
and so many-coloured, and bright. Her hair fell over her shoulders in long, delicate waves,
from under a little three pinnacled crown, like a tower. She was asking Neith about the laws
of architecture in Egypt and Greece; and when Neith told her the measures of the pyramids,
St. Barbara said she thought they would have been better three-cornered: and when Neith told
her the measures of the Parthenon, St. Barbara said she thought it ought to have had two transepts.
But she was pleased when Neith told her of the temple of the dew, and of the Caryan maidens
bearing its frieze: and then she thought that perhaps Neith would like to hear what sort of
temples she was building herself, in the French valleys, and on the crags of the Rhine. So
she began gossiping, just as one of you might to an old lady: and certainly she talked in the
sweetest way in the world to Neith; and explained to her all about crockets and pinnacles:
and Neith sat, looking very grave; and always graver as St. Barbara went on; till at last,
I'm sorry to say, St. Barbara lost her temper a little.

MAY (very grave herself). 'St. Barbara?'

L. Yes, May. Why shouldn't she? It was very tiresome of Neith to sit looking like that.

MAY. But, then, St. Barbara was a saint!

L. What's that, May?

MAY. A saint! A saint is--I am sure you know!

L. If I did, it would not make me sure that you knew too, May: but I don't.

VIOLET (expressing the incredulity of the audience). Oh,--sir!

L. That is to say, I know that people are called saints who are supposed to be better than
others: but I don't know how much better they must be, in order to be saints; nor how nearly
anybody may be a saint, and yet not be quite one; nor whether everybody who is called a saint
was one; nor whether everybody who isn't called a saint, isn't one.

     (General silence; the audience feeling themselves on the
     verge of the Infinities--and a little shocked--and much
     puzzled by so many questions at once.)

L. Besides, did you never hear that verse about being 'called to be saints'?

MAY (repeats Rom. i. 7.)

L. Quite right, May. Well, then, who are called to be that? People in Rome only?

MAY. Everybody, I suppose, whom God loves.

L. What! little girls as well as other people?

MAY. All grown-up people, I mean.

L. Why not little girls? Are they wickeder when they are little?

MAY. Oh, I hope not.

L. Why not little girls, then?

     (Pause.)

LILY. Because, you know, we can't be worth anything if we're ever so good;--I mean, if we try
to be ever so good; and we can't do difficult things--like saints.

L. I am afraid, my dear, that old people are not more able or willing for their difficulties
than you children are for yours. All I can say is, that if ever I see any of you, when you
are seven or eight and twenty, knitting your brows over any work you want to do or to understand,
as I saw you, Lily, knitting your brows over your slate this morning, I should think you very
noble women. But--to come back to my dream--St. Barbara did lose her temper a little; and I
was not surprised. For you can't think how provoking Neith looked, sitting there just like
a statue of sandstone; only going on weaving, like a machine; and never quickening the cast
of her shuttle; while St. Barbara was telling her so eagerly all about the most beautiful things,
and chattering away, as fast as bells ring on Christmas Eve, till she saw that Neith didn't
care; and then St. Barbara got as red as a rose, and stopped, just in time;--or I think she
would really have said something naughty.

ISABEL. Oh, please, but didn't Neith say anything then?

L. Yes. She said, quite quietly, 'It may be very pretty, my love; but it is all nonsense.'

ISABEL. Oh dear, oh dear; and then?

L. Well; then I was a little angry myself, and hoped St. Barbara would be quite angry; but
she wasn't. She bit her lips first; and then gave a great sigh--such a wild, sweet sigh--and
then she knelt down and hid her face on Neith's knees. Then Neith smiled a little, and was moved.

ISABEL. Oh, I am so glad!

L. And she touched St. Barbara's forehead with a flower of white lotus; and St. Barbara sobbed
once or twice, and then said: 'If you only could see how beautiful it is, and how much it makes
people feel what is good and lovely; and if you could only hear the children singing in the
Lady chapels!' And Neith smiled,--but still sadly,--and said, 'How do you know what I have
seen, or heard, my love? Do you think all those vaults and towers of yours have been built
without me? There was not a pillar in your Giotto's Santa Maria del Fiore which I did not set
true by my spearshaft as it rose. But this pinnacle and flame work which has set your little
heart on fire, is all vanity; and you will see what it will come to, and that soon; and none
will grieve for it more than I. And then every one will disbelieve your pretty symbols and
types. Men must be spoken simply to, my dear, if you would guide them kindly, and long.' But
St. Barbara answered, that, 'Indeed she thought every one liked her work,' and that 'the people
of different towns were as eager about their cathedral towers as about their privileges or
their markets;' and then she asked Neith to come and build something with her, wall against
tower; and 'see whether the people will be as much pleased with your building as with mine.'
But Neith answered, 'I will not contend with you, my dear. I strive not with those who love
me; and for those who hate me, it is not well to strive with me, as weaver Arachne knows. And
remember, child, that nothing is ever done beautifully, which is done in rivalship; nor nobly,
which is done in pride.'

Then St. Barbara hung her head quite down, and said she was very sorry she had been so foolish;
and kissed Neith; and stood thinking a minute: and then her eyes got bright again, and she
said, she would go directly and build a chapel with five windows in it; four for the four cardinal
virtues, and one for humility, in the middle, bigger than the rest. And Neith very nearly laughed
quite out, I thought; certainly her beautiful lips lost all their sternness for an instant;
then she said, 'Well, love, build it, but do not put so many colours into your windows as you
usually do; else no one will be able to see to read, inside: and when it is built, let a poor
village priest consecrate it, and not an archbishop.' St. Barbara started a little, I thought,
and turned as if to say something; but changed her mind, and gathered up her train, and went
out. And Neith bent herself again to her loom, in which she was weaving a web of strange dark
colours, I thought; but perhaps it was only after the glittering of St. Barbara's embroidered
train: and I tried to make out the figures in Neith's web, and confused myself among them,
as one always does in dreams; and then the dream changed altogether, and I found myself, all
at once, among a crowd of little Gothic and Egyptian spirits, who were quarrelling: at least
the Gothic ones were trying to quarrel; for the Egyptian ones only sat with their hands on
their knees, and their aprons sticking out very stiffly; and stared. And after a while I began
to understand what the matter was. It seemed that some of the troublesome building imps, who
meddle and make continually, even in the best Gothic work, had been listening to St. Barbara's
talk with Neith; and had made up their minds that Neith had no workpeople who could build against
them. They were but dull imps, as you may fancy by their thinking that; and never had done
much, except disturbing the great Gothic building angels at their work, and playing tricks
to each other; indeed, of late they had been living years and years, like bats, up under the
cornices of Strasbourg and Cologne cathedrals, with nothing to do but to make mouths at the
people below. However, they thought they knew everything about tower building; and those who
had heard what Neith said, told the rest; and they all flew down directly, chattering in German,
like jackdaws, to show Neith's people what they could do. And they had found some of Neith's
old workpeople somewhere near Sais, sitting in the sun, with their hands on their knees; and
abused them heartily: and Neith's people did not mind at first, but, after a while, they seemed
to get tired of the noise; and one or two rose up slowly, and laid hold of their measuring
rods, and said, 'If St. Barbara's people liked to build with them, tower against pyramid, they
would show them how to lay stones.' Then the little Gothic spirits threw a great many double
somersaults for joy; and put the tips of their tongues out slily to each other, on one side;
and I heard the Egyptians say, 'they must be some new kind of frog--they didn't think there
was much building in them.' However, the stiff old workers took their rods, as I said, and
measured out a square space of sand; but as soon as the German spirits saw that, they declared
they wanted exactly that bit of ground to build on, themselves. Then the Egyptian builders
offered to go farther off, and the Germans ones said, 'Ja wohl.' But as soon as the Egyptians
had measured out another square, the little Germans said they must have some of that too. Then
Neith's people laughed; and said, 'they might take as much as they liked, but they would not
move the plan of their pyramid again.' Then the little Germans took three pieces, and began
to build three spires directly; one large, and two little. And when the Egyptians saw they
had fairly begun, they laid their foundation all round, of large square stones: and began to
build, so steadily that they had like to have swallowed up the three little German spires.
So when the Gothic spirits saw that, they built their spires leaning, like the tower of Pisa,
that they might stick out at the side of the pyramid. And Neith's people stared at them; and
thought it very clever, but very wrong; and on they went, in their own way, and said nothing.
Then the little Gothic spirits were terribly provoked because they could not spoil the shape
of the pyramid; and they sat down all along the ledges of it to make faces; but that did no
good. Then they ran to the corners, and put their elbows on their knees, and stuck themselves
out as far as they could, and made more faces; but that did no good, neither. Then they looked
up to the sky, and opened their mouths wide, and gobbled, and said it was too hot for work,
and wondered when it would rain; but that did no good, neither. And all the while the Egyptian
spirits were laying step above step, patiently. But when the Gothic ones looked, and saw how
high they had got, they said, 'Ach, Himmel!' and flew down in a great black cluster to the
bottom; and swept out a level spot in the sand with their wings, in no time, and began building
a tower straight up, as fast as they could. And the Egyptians stood still again to stare at
them; for the Gothic spirits had got quite into a passion, and were really working very wonderfully.
They cut the sandstone into strips as fine as reeds; and put one reed on the top of another,
so that you could not see where they fitted: and they twisted them in and out like basket work,
and knotted them into likenesses of ugly faces, and of strange beasts biting each other; and
up they went, and up still, and they made spiral staircases at the corners, for the loaded
workers to come up by (for I saw they were but weak imps, and could not fly with stones on
their backs), and then they made traceried galleries for them to run round by; and so up again;
with finer and finer work, till the Egyptians wondered whether they meant the thing for a tower
or a pillar: and I heard them saying to one another, 'It was nearly as pretty as lotus stalks;
and if it were not for the ugly faces, there would be a fine temple, if they were going to
build it all with pillars as big as that!' But in a minute afterwards,--just as the Gothic
spirits had carried their work as high as the upper course, but three or four, of the pyramid--the
Egyptians called out to them to 'mind what they were about, for the sand was running away from
under one of their tower corners.' But it was too late to mind what they were about; for, in
another instant, the whole tower sloped aside; and the Gothic imps rose out of it like a flight
of puffins, in a single cloud; but screaming worse than any puffins you ever heard: and down
came the tower, all in a piece, like a falling poplar, with its head right on the flank of
the pyramid; against which it snapped short off. And of course that waked me!

MARY. What a shame of you to have such a dream, after all you have told us about Gothic architecture!

L. If you have understood anything I ever told you about it, you know that no architecture
was ever corrupted more miserably; or abolished more justly by the accomplishment of its own
follies. Besides, even in its days of power, it was subject to catastrophes of this kind. I
have stood too often, mourning, by the grand fragment of the apse of Beauvais, not to have
that fact well burnt into me. Still, you must have seen, surely, that these imps were of the
Flamboyant school; or, at least, of the German schools correspondent with it in extravagance.

MARY. But, then, where is the crystal about which you dreamed all this?

L. Here; but I suppose little Pthah has touched it again, for it is very small. But, you see,
here is the pyramid, built of great square stones of fluor spar, straight up; and here are
the three little pinnacles of mischievous quartz, which have set themselves, at the same time,
on the same foundation; only they lean like the tower of Pisa, and come out obliquely at the
side: and here is one great spire of quartz which seems as if it had been meant to stand straight
up, a little way off; and then had fallen down against the pyramid base, breaking its pinnacle
away. In reality, it has crystallised horizontally, and terminated imperfectly: but, then,
by what caprice does one crystal form horizontally, when all the rest stand upright? But this
is nothing to the phantasies of fluor, and quartz, and some other such companions, when they
get leave to do anything they like. I could show you fifty specimens, about every one of which
you might fancy a new fairy tale. Not that, in truth, any crystals get leave to do quite what
they like; and many of them are sadly tried, and have little time for caprices--poor things!

MARY. I thought they always looked as if they were either in play or in mischief! What trials
have they?

L. Trials much like our own. Sickness, and starvation; fevers, and agues, and palsy; oppression;
and old age, and the necessity of passing away in their time, like all else. If there's any
pity in you, you must come to-morrow, and take some part in these crystal griefs.

DORA. I am sure we shall cry till our eyes are red.

L. Ah, you may laugh, Dora: but I've been made grave, not once, nor twice, to see that even
crystals 'cannot choose but be old' at last. It may be but a shallow proverb of the Justice's;
but it is a shrewdly wide one.

DORA (pensive, for once). I suppose it is very dreadful to be old! But then (brightening again),
what should we do without our dear old friends, and our nice old lecturers?

L. If all nice old lecturers were minded as little as one I know of----

DORA. And if they all meant as little what they say, would they not deserve it? But we'll come--we'll
come, and cry.

LECTURE IX.

CRYSTAL SORROWS.

Working Lecture in Schoolroom.

L. We have been hitherto talking, children, as if crystals might live, and play, and quarrel,
and behave ill or well, according to their characters, without interruption from anything else.
But so far from this being so, nearly all crystals, whatever their characters, have to live
a hard life of it, and meet with many misfortunes. If we could see far enough, we should find,
indeed, that, at the root, all their vices were misfortunes: but to-day I want you to see what
sort of troubles the best crystals have to go through, occasionally, by no fault of their own.

This black thing, which is one of the prettiest of the very few pretty black things in the
world, is called 'Tourmaline.' It may be transparent, and green, or red, as well as black;
and then no stone can be prettier (only, all the light that gets into it, I believe, comes
out a good deal the worse; and is not itself again for a long while). But this is the commonest
state of it,--opaque, and as black as jet.

MARY. What does 'Tourmaline' mean?

L. They say it is Ceylanese, and I don't know Ceylanese; but we may always be thankful for
a graceful word, whatever it means.

MARY. And what is it made of?

L. A little of everything; there's always flint, and clay, and magnesia in it; and the black
is iron, according to its fancy; and there's boracic acid, if you know what that is; and if
you don't, I cannot tell you to-day; and it doesn't signify; and there's potash, and soda;
and, on the whole, the chemistry of it is more like a mediæval doctor's prescription, than
the making of a respectable mineral: but it may, perhaps, be owing to the strange complexity
of its make, that it has a notable habit which makes it, to me, one of the most interesting
of minerals. You see these two crystals are broken right across, in many places, just as if
they had been shafts of black marble fallen from a ruinous temple; and here they lie, imbedded
in white quartz, fragment succeeding fragment, keeping the line of the original crystal, while
the quartz fills up the intervening spaces. Now tourmaline has a trick of doing this, more
than any other mineral I know: here is another bit which I picked up on the glacier of Macugnaga;
it is broken, like a pillar built of very flat broad stones, into about thirty joints, and
all these are heaved and warped away from each other sideways, almost into a line of steps;
and then all is filled up with quartz paste. And here, lastly, is a green Indian piece, in
which the pillar is first disjointed, and then wrung round into the shape of an S.

MARY. How can this have been done?

L. There are a thousand ways in which it may have been done; the difficulty is not to account
for the doing of it; but for the showing of it in some crystals, and not in others. You never
by any chance get a quartz crystal broken or twisted in this way. If it break or twist at all,
which it does sometimes, like the spire of Dijon, it is by its own will or fault; it never
seems to have been passively crushed. But, for the forces which cause this passive ruin of
the tourmaline,--here is a stone which will show you multitudes of them in operation at once.
It is known as 'brecciated agate,' beautiful, as you see; and highly valued as a pebble: yet,
so far as I can read or hear, no one has ever looked at it with the least attention. At the
first glance, you see it is made of very fine red striped agates, which have been broken into
small pieces, and fastened together again by paste, also of agate. There would be nothing wonderful
in this, if this were all. It is well known that by the movements of strata, portions of rock
are often shattered to pieces:--well known also that agate is a deposit of flint by water under
certain conditions of heat and pressure: there is, therefore, nothing wonderful in an agate's
being broken; and nothing wonderful in its being mended with the solution out of which it was
itself originally congealed. And with this explanation, most people, looking at a brecciated
agate, or brecciated anything, seem to be satisfied. I was so myself, for twenty years; but,
lately happening to stay for some time at the Swiss Baden, where the beach of the Limmat is
almost wholly composed of brecciated limestones, I began to examine them thoughtfully; and
perceived, in the end, that they were, one and all, knots of as rich mystery as any poor little
human brain was ever lost in. That piece of agate in your hand, Mary, will show you many of
the common phenomena of breccias; but you need not knit your brows over it in that way; depend
upon it, neither you nor I shall ever know anything about the way it was made, as long as we live.

DORA. That does not seem much to depend upon.

L. Pardon me, puss. When once we gain some real notion of the extent and the unconquerableness
of our ignorance, it is a very broad and restful thing to depend upon: you can throw yourself
upon it at ease, as on a cloud, to feast with the gods. You do not thenceforward trouble yourself,--nor
any one else,--with theories, or the contradiction of theories; you neither get headache nor
heartburning; and you never more waste your poor little store of strength, or allowance of time.

However, there are certain facts, about this agate-making, which I can tell you; and then you
may look at it in a pleasant wonder as long as you like; pleasant wonder is no loss of time.

First, then, it is not broken freely by a blow; it is slowly wrung, or ground, to pieces. You
can only with extreme dimness conceive the force exerted on mountains in transitional states
of movement. You have all read a little geology; and you know how coolly geologists talk of
mountains being raised or depressed. They talk coolly of it, because they are accustomed to
the fact; but the very universality of the fact prevents us from ever conceiving distinctly
the conditions of force involved. You know I was living last year in Savoy; my house was on
the back of a sloping mountain which rose gradually for two miles, behind it; and then fell
at once in a great precipice towards Geneva, going down three thousand feet in four or five
cliffs, or steps. Now that whole group of cliffs had simply been torn away by sheer strength
from the rocks below, as if the whole mass had been as soft as biscuit. Put four or five captains'
biscuits on the floor, on the top of one another; and try to break them all in half, not by
bending, but by holding one half down, and tearing the other halves straight up;--of course
you will not be able to do it, but you will feel and comprehend the sort of force needed. Then,
fancy each captains' biscuit a bed of rock, six or seven hundred feet thick; and the whole
mass torn straight through; and one half heaved up three thousand feet, grinding against the
other as it rose,--and you will have some idea of the making of the Mont Saléve.

MAY. But it must crush the rocks all to dust!

L. No; for there is no room for dust. The pressure is too great; probably the heat developed
also so great that the rock is made partly ductile; but the worst of it is, that we never can
see these parts of mountains in the state they were left in at the time of their elevation;
for it is precisely in these rents and dislocations that the crystalline power principally
exerts itself. It is essentially a styptic power, and wherever the earth is torn, it heals
and binds; nay, the torture and grieving of the earth seem necessary to bring out its full
energy; for you only find the crystalline living power fully in action, where the rents and
faults are deep and many.

DORA. If you please, sir,--would you tell us--what are 'faults'?

L. You never heard of such things?

DORA. Never in all our lives.

L. When a vein of rock which is going on smoothly, is interrupted by another troublesome little
vein, which stops it, and puts it out, so that it has to begin again in another place--that
is called a fault. I always think it ought to be called the fault of the vein that interrupts
it; but the miners always call it the fault of the vein that is interrupted.

DORA. So it is, if it does not begin again where it left off.

L. Well, that is certainly the gist of the business: but, whatever good-natured old lecturers
may do, the rocks have a bad habit, when they are once interrupted, of never asking 'Where was I?'

DORA. When the two halves of the dining table came separate, yesterday, was that a 'fault'?

L. Yes; but not the table's. However, it is not a bad illustration, Dora. When beds of rock
are only interrupted by a fissure, but remain at the same level, like the two halves of the
table, it is not called a fault, but only a fissure; but if one half of the table be either
tilted higher than the other, or pushed to the side, so that the two parts will not fit, it
is a fault. You had better read the chapter on faults in Jukes's Geology; then you will know
all about it. And this rent that I am telling you of in the Saléve, is one only of myriads,
to which are owing the forms of the Alps, as, I believe, of all great mountain chains. Wherever
you see a precipice on any scale of real magnificence, you will nearly always find it owing
to some dislocation of this kind; but the point of chief wonder to me, is the delicacy of the
touch by which these gigantic rents have been apparently accomplished. Note, however, that
we have no clear evidence, hitherto, of the time taken to produce any of them. We know that
a change of temperature alters the position and the angles of the atoms of crystals, and also
the entire bulk of rocks. We know that in all volcanic, and the greater part of all subterranean,
action, temperatures are continually changing, and therefore masses of rock must be expanding
or contracting, with infinite slowness, but with infinite force. This pressure must result
in mechanical strain somewhere, both in their own substance, and in that of the rocks surrounding
them; and we can form no conception of the result of irresistible pressure, applied so as to
rend and raise, with imperceptible slowness of gradation, masses thousands of feet in thickness.
We want some experiments tried on masses of iron and stone; and we can't get them tried, because
Christian creatures never will seriously and sufficiently spend money, except to find out the
shortest ways of killing each other. But, besides this slow kind of pressure, there is evidence
of more or less sudden violence, on the same terrific scale; and, through it all, the wonder,
as I said, is always to me the delicacy of touch. I cut a block of the Saléve limestone from
the edge of one of the principal faults which have formed the precipice; it is a lovely compact
limestone, and the fault itself is filled up with a red breccia formed of the crushed fragments
of the torn rock, cemented by a rich red crystalline paste. I have had the piece I cut from
it smoothed, and polished across the junction; here it is; and you may now pass your soft little
fingers over the surface, without so much as feeling the place where a rock which all the hills
of England might have been sunk in the body of, and not a summit seen, was torn asunder through
that whole thickness, as a thin dress is torn when you tread upon it.

     (The audience examine the stone, and touch it timidly; but
     the matter remains inconceivable to them.)

MARY (struck by the beauty of the stone). But this is almost marble?

L. It is quite marble. And another singular point in the business, to my mind, is that these
stones, which men have been cutting into slabs, for thousands of years, to ornament their principal
buildings with,--and which, under the general name of 'marble,' have been the delight of the
eyes, and the wealth of architecture, among all civilised nations,--are precisely those on
which the signs and brands of these earth agonies have been chiefly struck; and there is not
a purple vein nor flaming zone in them, which is not the record of their ancient torture. What
a boundless capacity for sleep, and for serene stupidity, there is in the human mind! Fancy
reflective beings, who cut and polish stones for three thousand years, for the sake of the
pretty stains upon them; and educate themselves to an art at last (such as it is), of imitating
these veins by dexterous painting; and never a curious soul of them, all that while, asks,
'What painted the rocks?'

     (The audience look dejected, and ashamed of themselves.)

The fact is, we are all, and always, asleep, through our lives; and it is only by pinching
ourselves very hard that we ever come to see, or understand, anything. At least, it is not
always we who pinch ourselves; sometimes other people pinch us; which I suppose is very good
of them,--or other things, which I suppose is very proper of them. But it is a sad life; made
up chiefly of naps and pinches.

     (Some of the audience, on this, appearing to think that the
     others require pinching, the LECTURER changes the
     subject.)

Now, however, for once, look at a piece of marble carefully, and think about it. You see this
is one side of the fault; the other side is down or up, nobody knows where; but, on this side,
you can trace the evidence of the dragging and tearing action. All along the edge of this marble,
the ends of the fibres of the rock are torn, here an inch, and there half an inch, away from
each other; and you see the exact places where they fitted, before they were torn separate;
and you see the rents are now all filled up with the sanguine paste, full of the broken pieces
of the rock; the paste itself seems to have been half melted, and partly to have also melted
the edge of the fragments it contains, and then to have crystallised with them, and round them.
And the brecciated agate I first showed you contains exactly the same phenomena; a zoned crystallisation
going on amidst the cemented fragments, partly altering the structure of those fragments themselves,
and subject to continual change, either in the intensity of its own power, or in the nature
of the materials submitted to it;--so that, at one time, gravity acts upon them, and disposes
them in horizontal layers, or causes them to droop in stalactites; and at another, gravity
is entirely defied, and the substances in solution are crystallised in bands of equal thickness
on every side of the cell. It would require a course of lectures longer than these (I have
a great mind,--you have behaved so saucily--to stay and give them) to describe to you the phenomena
of this kind, in agates and chalcedonies only;--nay, there is a single sarcophagus in the British
Museum, covered with grand sculpture of the 18th dynasty, which contains in the magnificent
breccia (agates and jaspers imbedded in porphyry), out of which it is hewn, material for the
thought of years; and record of the earth-sorrow of ages in comparison with the duration of
which, the Egyptian letters tell us but the history of the evening and morning of a day.

Agates, I think, of all stones, confess most of their past history; but all crystallisation
goes on under, and partly records, circumstances of this kind--circumstances of infinite variety,
but always involving difficulty, interruption, and change of condition at different times.
Observe, first, you have the whole mass of the rock in motion, either contracting itself, and
so gradually widening the cracks; or being compressed, and thereby closing them, and crushing
their edges;--and, if one part of its substance be softer, at the given temperature, than another,
probably squeezing that softer substance out into the veins. Then the veins themselves, when
the rock leaves them open by its contraction, act with various power of suction upon its substance;--by
capillary attraction when they are fine,--by that of pure vacuity when they are larger, or
by changes in the constitution and condensation of the mixed gases with which they have been
originally filled. Those gases themselves may be supplied in all variation of volume and power
from below; or, slowly, by the decomposition of the rocks themselves; and, at changing temperatures,
must exert relatively changing forces of decomposition and combination on the walls of the
veins they fill; while water, at every degree of heat and pressure (from beds of everlasting
ice, alternate with cliffs of native rock, to volumes of red hot, or white hot, steam), congeals,
and drips, and throbs, and thrills, from crag to crag; and breathes from pulse to pulse of
foaming or fiery arteries, whose beating is felt through chains of the great islands of the
Indian seas, as your own pulses lift your bracelets, and makes whole kingdoms of the world
quiver in deadly earthquake, as if they were light as aspen leaves. And, remember, the poor
little crystals have to live their lives, and mind their own affairs, in the midst of all this,
as best they may. They are wonderfully like human creatures,--forget all that is going on if
they don't see it, however dreadful; and never think what is to happen to-morrow. They are
spiteful or loving, and indolent or painstaking, and orderly or licentious, with no thought
whatever of the lava or the flood which may break over them any day; and evaporate them into
air-bubbles, or wash them into a solution of salts. And you may look at them, once understanding
the surrounding conditions of their fate, with an endless interest. You will see crowds of
unfortunate little crystals, who have been forced to constitute themselves in a hurry, their
dissolving element being fiercely scorched away; you will see them doing their best, bright
and numberless, but tiny. Then you will find indulged crystals, who have had centuries to form
themselves in, and have changed their mind and ways continually; and have been tired, and taken
heart again; and have been sick, and got well again; and thought they would try a different
diet, and then thought better of it; and made but a poor use of their advantages, after all.
And others you will see, who have begun life as wicked crystals; and then have been impressed
by alarming circumstances, and have become converted crystals, and behaved amazingly for a
little while, and fallen away again, and ended, but discreditably, perhaps even in decomposition;
so that one doesn't know what will become of them. And sometimes you will see deceitful crystals,
that look as soft as velvet, and are deadly to all near them; and sometimes you will see deceitful
crystals, that seem flint-edged, like our little quartz-crystal of a housekeeper here, (hush!
Dora,) and are endlessly gentle and true wherever gentleness and truth are needed. And sometimes
you will see little child-crystals put to school like school-girls, and made to stand in rows;
and taken the greatest care of, and taught how to hold themselves up, and behave: and sometimes
you will see unhappy little child-crystals left to lie about in the dirt, and pick up their
living, and learn manners, where they can. And sometimes you will see fat crystals eating up
thin ones, like great capitalists and little labourers; and politico-economic crystals teaching
the stupid ones how to eat each other, and cheat each other; and foolish crystals getting in
the way of wise ones; and impatient crystals spoiling the plans of patient ones, irreparably;
just as things go on in the world. And sometimes you may see hypocritical crystals taking the
shape of others, though they are nothing like in their minds; and vampire crystals eating out
the hearts of others; and hermit-crab crystals living in the shells of others; and parasite
crystals living on the means of others; and courtier crystals glittering in attendance upon
others; and all these, besides the two great companies of war and peace, who ally themselves,
resolutely to attack, or resolutely to defend. And for the close, you see the broad shadow
and deadly force of inevitable fate, above all this: you see the multitudes of crystals whose
time has come; not a set time, as with us, but yet a time, sooner or later, when they all must
give up their crystal ghosts:--when the strength by which they grew, and the breath given them
to breathe, pass away from them; and they fail, and are consumed, and vanish away; and another
generation is brought to life, framed out of their ashes.

MARY. It is very terrible. Is it not the complete fulfilment, down into the very dust, of that
verse: 'The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain'?

L. I do not know that it is in pain, Mary: at least, the evidence tends to show that there
is much more pleasure than pain, as soon as sensation becomes possible.

LUCILLA. But then, surely, if we are told that it is pain, it must be pain?

L. Yes; if we are told; and told in the way you mean, Lucilla; but nothing is said of the proportion
to pleasure. Unmitigated pain would kill any of us in a few hours; pain equal to our pleasures
would make us loathe life; the word itself cannot be applied to the lower conditions of matter,
in its ordinary sense. But wait till to-morrow to ask me about this. To-morrow is to be kept
for questions and difficulties; let us keep to the plain facts to-day. There is yet one group
of facts connected with this rending of the rocks, which I especially want you to notice. You
know, when you have mended a very old dress, quite meritoriously, till it won't mend any more----

EGYPT (interrupting). Could not you sometimes take gentlemen's work to illustrate by?

L. Gentlemen's work is rarely so useful as yours, Egypt; and when it is useful, girls cannot
easily understand it.

DORA. I am sure we should understand it better than gentlemen understand about sewing.

L. My dear, I hope I always speak modestly, and under correction, when I touch upon matters
of the kind too high for me; and besides, I never intend to speak otherwise than respectfully
of sewing;--though you always seem to think I am laughing at you. In all seriousness, illustrations
from sewing are those which Neith likes me best to use; and which young ladies ought to like
everybody to use. What do you think the beautiful word 'wife' comes from?

DORA (tossing her head). I don't think it is a particularly beautiful word.

L. Perhaps not. At your ages you may think 'bride' sounds better; but wife's the word for wear,
depend upon it. It is the great word in which the English and Latin languages conquer the French
and the Greek. I hope the French will some day get a word for it, yet, instead of their dreadful
'femme.' But what do you think it comes from?

DORA. I never did think about it.

L. Nor you, Sibyl?

SIBYL. No; I thought it was Saxon, and stopped there.

L. Yes; but the great good of Saxon words is, that they usually do mean something. Wife means
'weaver.' You have all the right to call yourselves little 'housewives,' when you sew neatly.

DORA. But I don't think we want to call ourselves 'little housewives.'

L. You must either be house-Wives, or house-Moths; remember that. In the deep sense, you must
either weave men's fortunes, and embroider them; or feed upon, and bring them to decay. You
had better let me keep my sewing illustration, and help me out with it.

DORA. Well we'll hear it, under protest.

L. You have heard it before; but with reference to other matters. When it is said, 'no man
putteth a piece of new cloth on an old garment, else it taketh from the old,' does it not mean
that the new piece tears the old one away at the sewn edge?

DORA. Yes; certainly.

L. And when you mend a decayed stuff with strong thread, does not the whole edge come away
sometimes, when it tears again?

DORA. Yes; and then it is of no use to mend it any more.

L. Well, the rocks don't seem to think that: but the same thing happens to them continually.
I told you they were full of rents, or veins. Large masses of mountain are sometimes as full
of veins as your hand is; and of veins nearly as fine (only you know a rock vein does not mean
a tube, but a crack or cleft). Now these clefts are mended, usually, with the strongest material
the rock can find; and often literally with threads; for the gradually opening rent seems to
draw the substance it is filled with into fibres, which cross from one side of it to the other,
and are partly crystalline; so that, when the crystals become distinct, the fissure has often
exactly the look of a tear, brought together with strong cross stitches. Now when this is completely
done, and all has been fastened and made firm, perhaps some new change of temperature may occur,
and the rock begin to contract again. Then the old vein must open wider; or else another open
elsewhere. If the old vein widen, it may do so at its centre; but it constantly happens, with
well filled veins, that the cross stitches are too strong to break; the walls of the vein,
instead, are torn away by them; and another little supplementary vein--often three or four
successively--will be thus formed at the side of the first.

MARY. That is really very much like our work. But what do the mountains use to sew with?

L. Quartz, whenever they can get it: pure limestones are obliged to be content with carbonate
of lime; but most mixed rocks can find some quartz for themselves. Here is a piece of black
slate from the Buet: it looks merely like dry dark mud;--you could not think there was any
quartz in it; but, you see, its rents are all stitched together with beautiful white thread,
which is the purest quartz, so close drawn that you can break it like flint, in the mass; but,
where it has been exposed to the weather, the fine fibrous structure is shown: and, more than
that, you see the threads have been all twisted and pulled aside, this way and the other, by
the warpings and shifting of the sides of the vein as it widened.

MARY. It is wonderful! But is that going on still? Are the mountains being torn and sewn together
again at this moment?

L. Yes, certainly, my dear: but I think, just as certainly (though geologists differ on this
matter), not with the violence, or on the scale, of their ancient ruin and renewal. All things
seem to be tending towards a condition of at least temporary rest; and that groaning and travailing
of the creation, as, assuredly, not wholly in pain, is not, in the full sense, 'until now.'

MARY. I want so much to ask you about that!

SIBYL. Yes; and we all want to ask you about a great many other things besides.

L. It seems to me that you have got quite as many new ideas as are good for any of you at present:
and I should not like to burden you with more; but I must see that those you have are clear,
if I can make them so; so we will have one more talk, for answer of questions, mainly. Think
over all the ground, and make your difficulties thoroughly presentable. Then we'll see what
we can make of them.

DORA. They shall all be dressed in their very best; and curtsey as they come in.

L. No, no, Dora; no curtseys, if you please. I had enough of them the day you all took a fit
of reverence, and curtsied me out of the room.

DORA. But, you know, we cured ourselves of the fault, at once, by that fit. We have never been
the least respectful since. And the difficulties will only curtsey themselves out of the room,
I hope;--come in at one door--vanish at the other.

L. What a pleasant world it would be, if all its difficulties were taught to behave so! However,
one can generally make something, or (better still) nothing, or at least less, of them, if
they thoroughly know their own minds; and your difficulties--I must say that for you, children,--generally
do know their own minds, as you do yourselves.

DORA. That is very kindly said for us. Some people would not allow so much as that girls had
any minds to know.

L. They will at least admit that you have minds to change, Dora.

MARY. You might have left us the last speech, without a retouch. But we'll put our little minds,
such as they are, in the best trim we can, for to-morrow.

LECTURE X.

THE CRYSTAL REST.

     Evening. The fireside. L's arm-chair in the comfortablest
     corner.

L. (perceiving various arrangements being made of foot-stool, cushion, screen, and the like).
Yes, yes, it's all very fine! and I am to sit here to be asked questions till supper-time, am I?

DORA. I don't think you can have any supper to-night:--we've got so much to ask.

LILY. Oh, Miss Dora! We can fetch it him here, you know, so nicely!

L. Yes, Lily, that will be pleasant, with competitive examination going on over one's plate;
the competition being among the examiners. Really, now that I know what teasing things girls
are, I don't so much wonder that people used to put up patiently with the dragons who took
them for supper. But I can't help myself, I suppose;--no thanks to St. George. Ask away, children,
and I'll answer as civilly as may be.

DORA. We don't so much care about being answered civilly, as about not being asked things back
again.

L. 'Ayez seulement la patience que je le parle.' There shall be no requitals.

DORA. Well, then, first of all--What shall we ask first, Mary?

MARY. It does not matter. I think all the questions come into one, at last, nearly.

DORA. You know, you always talk as if the crystals were alive; and we never understand how
much you are in play, and how much in earnest. That's the first thing.

L. Neither do I understand, myself, my dear, how much I am in earnest. The stones puzzle me
as much as I puzzle you. They look as if they were alive, and make me speak as if they were;
and I do not in the least know how much truth there is in the appearance. I'm not to ask things
back again to-night, but all questions of this sort lead necessarily to the one main question,
which we asked, before, in vain, 'What is it to be alive?'

DORA. Yes; but we want to come back to that: for we've been reading scientific books about
the 'conservation of forces,' and it seems all so grand, and wonderful; and the experiments
are so pretty; and I suppose it must be all right: but then the books never speak as if there
were any such thing as 'life.'

L. They mostly omit that part of the subject, certainly, Dora; but they are beautifully right
as far as they go; and life is not a convenient element to deal with. They seem to have been
getting some of it into and out of bottles, in their 'ozone' and 'antizone' lately; but they
still know little of it: and, certainly, I know less.

DORA. You promised not to be provoking, to-night.

L. Wait a minute. Though, quite truly, I know less of the secrets of life than the philosophers
do; I yet know one corner of ground on which we artists can stand, literally as 'Life Guards'
at bay, as steadily as the Guards at Inkermann; however hard the philosophers push. And you
may stand with us, if once you learn to draw nicely.

DORA. I'm sure we are all trying! but tell us where we may stand. The kettle chooses to sit
still on the hob; the eagle to recline on the air. It is the fact of the choice, not the equal
degree of temperature in the fulfilment of it, which appears to us the more interesting circumstance;--though
the other is very interesting too. Exceedingly so! Don't laugh, children; the philosophers
have been doing quite splendid work lately, in their own way: especially, the transformation
of force into light is a great piece of systematised discovery; and this notion about the sun's
being supplied with his flame by ceaseless meteoric hail is grand, and looks very likely to
be true. Of course, it is only the old gun-lock,--flint and steel,--on a large scale: but the
order and majesty of it are sublime. Still, we sculptors and painters care little about it.
'It is very fine,' we say, 'and very useful, this knocking the light out of the sun, or into
it, by an eternal cataract of planets. But you may hail away, so, for ever, and you will not
knock out what we can. Here is a bit of silver, not the size of half-a-crown, on which, with
a single hammer stroke, one of us, two thousand and odd years ago, hit out the head of the
Apollo of Clazomenæ. It is merely a matter of form; but if any of you philosophers, with your
whole planetary system to hammer with, can hit out such another bit of silver as this,--we
will take off our hats to you. For the present, we keep them on.'

MARY. Yes, I understand; and that is nice; but I don't think we shall any of us like having
only form to depend upon.

L. It was not neglected in the making of Eve, my dear.

MARY. It does not seem to separate us from the dust of the ground. It is that breathing of
the life which we want to understand.

L. So you should: but hold fast to the form, and defend that first, as distinguished from the
mere transition of forces. Discern the moulding hand of the potter commanding the clay, from
his merely beating foot, as it turns the wheel. If you can find incense, in the vase, afterwards,--well:
but it is curious how far mere form will carry you ahead of the philosophers. For instance,
with regard to the most interesting of all their modes of force--light;--they never consider
how far the existence of it depends on the putting of certain vitreous and nervous substances
into the formal arrangement which we call an eye. The German philosophers began the attack,
long ago, on the other side, by telling us, there was no such thing as light at all, unless
we chose to see it: now, German and English, both, have reversed their engines, and insist
that light would be exactly the same light that it is, though nobody could ever see it. The
fact being that the force must be there, and the eyes there; and 'light' means the effect of
the one on the other;--and perhaps, also--(Plato saw farther into that mystery than any one
has since, that I know of),--on something a little way within the eyes; but we may stand quite
safe, close behind the retina, and defy the philosophers.

SIBYL. But I don't care so much about defying the philosophers, if only one could get a clear
idea of life, or soul, for one's self.

L. Well, Sibyl, you used to know more about it, in that cave of yours, than any of us. I was
just going to ask you about inspiration, and the golden bough, and the like; only I remembered
I was not to ask anything. But, will not you, at least, tell us whether the ideas of Life,
as the power of putting things together, or 'making' them; and of Death, as the power of pushing
things separate, or 'unmaking' them, may not be very simply held in balance against each other?

SIBYL. No, I am not in my cave to-night; and cannot tell you anything.

L. I think they may. Modern Philosophy is a great separator; it is little more than the expansion
of Molière's great sentence, 'Il s'ensuit de là, que tout ce qu'il y a de beau est dans les
dictionnaires; il n'y a que les mots qui sont transposés.' But when you used to be in your
cave, Sibyl, and to be inspired, there was (and there remains still in some small measure),
beyond the merely formative and sustaining power, another, which we painters call 'passion'--I
don't know what the philosophers call it; we know it makes people red, or white; and therefore
it must be something, itself; and perhaps it is the most truly 'poetic' or 'making' force of
all, creating a world of its own out of a glance, or a sigh: and the want of passion is perhaps
the truest death, or 'unmaking' of everything;--even of stones. By the way, you were all reading
about that ascent of the Aiguille Verte, the other day?

SIBYL. Because you had told us it was so difficult, you thought it could not be ascended.

L. Yes; I believed the Aiguille Verte would have held its own. But do you recollect what one
of the climbers exclaimed, when he first felt sure of reaching the summit?

SIBYL. Yes, it was, 'Oh, Aiguille Verte, vous êtes morte, vous êtes morte!'

L. That was true instinct. Real philosophic joy. Now can you at all fancy the difference between
that feeling of triumph in a mountain's death; and the exultation of your beloved poet, in
its life--

    'Quantus Athos, aut quantus Eryx, aut ipse coruscis
    Quum fremit ilicibus quantus, gandetque nivali
    Vertice, se attollens pater Apenninus ad auras.'

DORA. You must translate for us mere house-keepers, please,--whatever the cave-keepers may
know about it.

MARY. Will Dryden do?

L. No. Dryden is a far way worse than nothing, and nobody will 'do.' You can't translate it.
But this is all you need know, that the lines are full of a passionate sense of the Apennines'
fatherhood, or protecting power over Italy; and of sympathy with their joy in their snowy strength
in heaven; and with the same joy, shuddering through all the leaves of their forests.

MARY. Yes, that is a difference indeed! but then, you know, one can't help feeling that it
is fanciful. It is very delightful to imagine the mountains to be alive; but then,--are they alive?

L. It seems to me, on the whole, Mary, that the feelings of the purest and most mightily passioned
human souls are likely to be the truest. Not, indeed, if they do not desire to know the truth,
or blind themselves to it that they may please themselves with passion; for then they are no
longer pure: but if, continually seeking and accepting the truth as far as it is discernible,
they trust their Maker for the integrity of the instincts He has gifted them with, and rest
in the sense of a higher truth which they cannot demonstrate, I think they will be most in
the right, so.

DORA and JESSIE (clapping their hands). Then we really may believe that the mountains are living?

L. You may at least earnestly believe, that the presence of the spirit which culminates in
your own life, shows itself in dawning, wherever the dust of the earth begins to assume any
orderly and lovely state. You will find it impossible to separate this idea of gradated manifestation
from that of the vital power. Things are not either wholly alive, or wholly dead. They are
less or more alive. Take the nearest, most easily examined instance--the life of a flower.
Notice what a different degree and kind of life there is in the calyx and the corolla. The
calyx is nothing but the swaddling clothes of the flower; the child-blossom is bound up in
it, hand and foot; guarded in it, restrained by it, till the time of birth. The shell is hardly
more subordinate to the germ in the egg, than the calyx to the blossom. It bursts at last;
but it never lives as the corolla does. It may fall at the moment its task is fulfilled, as
in the poppy; or wither gradually, as in the buttercup; or persist in a ligneous apathy, after
the flower is dead, as in the rose; or harmonise itself so as to share in the aspect of the
real flower, as in the lily; but it never shares in the corolla's bright passion of life. And
the gradations which thus exist between the different members of organic creatures, exist no
less between the different ranges of organism. We know no higher or more energetic life than
our own; but there seems to me this great good in the idea of gradation of life--it admits
the idea of a life above us, in other creatures, as much nobler than ours, as ours is nobler
than that of the dust.

MARY. I am glad you have said that; for I know Violet and Lucilla and May want to ask you something;
indeed, we all do; only you frightened Violet so about the ant-hill, that she can't say a word;
and May is afraid of your teasing her, too: but I know they are wondering why you are always
telling them about heathen gods and goddesses, as if you half believed in them; and you represent
them as good; and then we see there is really a kind of truth in the stories about them; and
we are all puzzled: and, in this, we cannot even make our difficulty quite clear to ourselves;--it
would be such a long confused question, if we could ask you all we should like to know.

L. Nor is it any wonder, Mary; for this is indeed the longest, and the most wildly confused
question that reason can deal with; but I will try to give you, quickly, a few clear ideas
about the heathen gods, which you may follow out afterwards, as your knowledge increases.

Every heathen conception of deity in which you are likely to be interested, has three distinct
characters:--

I. It has a physical character. It represents some of the great powers or objects of nature--sun
or moon, or heaven, or the winds, or the sea. And the fables first related about each deity
represent, figuratively, the action of the natural power which it represents; such as the rising
and setting of the sun, the tides of the sea, and so on.

II. It has an ethical character, and represents, in its history, the moral dealings of God
with man. Thus Apollo is first, physically, the sun contending with darkness; but morally,
the power of divine life contending with corruption. Athena is, physically, the air; morally,
the breathing of the divine spirit of wisdom. Neptune is, physically, the sea; morally, the
supreme power of agitating passion; and so on.

III. It has, at last, a personal character; and is realised in the minds of its worshippers
as a living spirit, with whom men may speak face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.

Now it is impossible to define exactly, how far, at any period of a national religion, these
three ideas are mingled; or how far one prevails over the other. Each enquirer usually takes
up one of these ideas, and pursues it, to the exclusion of the others: no impartial effort
seems to have been made to discern the real state of the heathen imagination in its successive
phases. For the question is not at all what a mythological figure meant in its origin; but
what it became in each subsequent mental development of the nation inheriting the thought.
Exactly in proportion to the mental and moral insight of any race, its mythological figures
mean more to it, and become more real. An early and savage race means nothing more (because
it has nothing more to mean) by its Apollo, than the sun; while a cultivated Greek means every
operation of divine intellect and justice. The Neith, of Egypt, meant, physically, little more
than the blue of the air; but the Greek, in a climate of alternate storm and calm, represented
the wild fringes of the storm-cloud by the serpents of her ægis; and the lightning and cold
of the highest thunder-clouds, by the Gorgon on her shield: while morally, the same types represented
to him the mystery and changeful terror of knowledge, as her spear and helm its ruling and
defensive power. And no study can be more interesting, or more useful to you, than that of
the different meanings which have been created by great nations, and great poets, out of mythological
figures given them, at first, in utter simplicity. But when we approach them in their third,
or personal, character (and, for its power over the whole national mind, this is far the leading
one), we are met at once by questions which may well put all of you at pause. Were they idly
imagined to be real beings? and did they so usurp the place of the true God? Or were they actually
real beings--evil spirits,--leading men away from the true God? Or is it conceivable that they
might have been real beings,--good spirits,--entrusted with some message from the true God?
These were the questions you wanted to ask; were they not, Lucilla?

LUCILLA. Yes, indeed.

L. Well, Lucilla, the answer will much depend upon the clearness of your faith in the personality
of the spirits which are described in the book of your own religion;--their personality, observe,
as distinguished from merely symbolical visions. For instance, when Jeremiah has the vision
of the seething pot with its mouth to the north, you know that this which he sees is not a
real thing; but merely a significant dream. Also, when Zechariah sees the speckled horses among
the myrtle trees in the bottom, you still may suppose the vision symbolical;--you do not think
of them as real spirits, like Pegasus, seen in the form of horses. But when you are told of
the four riders in the Apocalypse, a distinct sense of personality begins to force itself upon
you. And though you might, in a dull temper, think that (for one instance of all) the fourth
rider on the pale horse was merely a symbol of the power of death,--in your stronger and more
earnest moods you will rather conceive of him as a real and living angel. And when you look
back from the vision of the Apocalypse to the account of the destruction of the Egyptian first-born,
and of the army of Sennacherib, and again to David's vision at the threshing floor of Araunah,
the idea of personality in this death-angel becomes entirely defined, just as in the appearance
of the angels to Abraham, Manoah, or Mary.

Now, when you have once consented to this idea of a personal spirit, must not the question
instantly follow: 'Does this spirit exercise its functions towards one race of men only, or
towards all men? Was it an angel of death to the Jew only, or to the Gentile also?' You find
a certain Divine agency made visible to a King of Israel, as an armed angel, executing vengeance,
of which one special purpose was to lower his kingly pride. You find another (or perhaps the
same) agency, made visible to a Christian prophet as an angel standing in the sun, calling
to the birds that fly under heaven to come, that they may eat the flesh of kings. Is there
anything impious in the thought that the same agency might have been expressed to a Greek king,
or Greek seer, by similar visions?--that this figure, standing in the sun, and armed with the
sword, or the bow (whose arrows were drunk with blood), and exercising especially its power
in the humiliation of the proud, might, at first, have been called only 'Destroyer,' and afterwards,
as the light, or sun, of justice, was recognised in the chastisement, called also 'Physician'
or 'Healer?' If you feel hesitation in admitting the possibility of such a manifestation, I
believe you will find it is caused, partly indeed by such trivial things as the difference
to your ear between Greek and English terms; but, far more, by uncertainty in your own mind
respecting the nature and truth of the visions spoken of in the Bible. Have any of you intently
examined the nature of your belief in them? You, for instance, Lucilla, who think often, and
seriously, of such things?

LUCILLA. No; I never could tell what to believe about them. I know they must be true in some
way or other; and I like reading about them.

L. Yes; and I like reading about them too, Lucilla; as I like reading other grand poetry. But,
surely, we ought both to do more than like it? Will God be satisfied with us, think you, if
we read His words merely for the sake of an entirely meaningless poetical sensation?

LUCILLA. But do not the people who give themselves to seek out the meaning of these things,
often get very strange, and extravagant?

L. More than that, Lucilla. They often go mad. That abandonment of the mind to religious theory,
or contemplation, is the very thing I have been pleading with you against. I never said you
should set yourself to discover the meanings; but you should take careful pains to understand
them, so far as they are clear; and you should always accurately ascertain the state of your
mind about them. I want you never to read merely for the pleasure of fancy; still less as a
formal religious duty (else you might as well take to repeating Paters at once; for it is surely
wiser to repeat one thing we understand, than read a thousand which we cannot). Either, therefore,
acknowledge the passages to be, for the present, unintelligible to you; or else determine the
sense in which you at present receive them; or, at all events, the different senses between
which you clearly see that you must choose. Make either your belief, or your difficulty, definite;
but do not go on, all through your life, believing nothing intelligently, and yet supposing
that your having read the words of a divine book must give you the right to despise every religion
but your own. I assure you, strange as it may seem, our scorn of Greek tradition depends, not
on our belief, but our disbelief, of our own traditions. We have, as yet, no sufficient clue
to the meaning of either; but you will always find that, in proportion to the earnestness of
our own faith, its tendency to accept a spiritual personality increases: and that the most
vital and beautiful Christian temper rests joyfully in its conviction of the multitudinous
ministry of living angels, infinitely varied in rank and power. You all know one expression
of the purest and happiest form of such faith, as it exists in modern times, in Richter's lovely
illustrations of the Lord's Prayer. The real and living death-angel, girt as a pilgrim for
journey, and softly crowned with flowers, beckons at the dying mother's door; child-angels
sit talking face to face with mortal children, among the flowers;--hold them by their little
coats, lest they fall on the stairs;--whisper dreams of heaven to them, leaning over their
pillows; carry the sound of the church bells for them far through the air; and even descending
lower in service, fill little cups with honey, to hold out to the weary bee. By the way, Lily,
did you tell the other children that story about your little sister, and Alice, and the sea?

LILY. I told it to Alice, and to Miss Dora. I don't think I did to anybody else. I thought
it wasn't worth.

L. We shall think it worth a great deal now, Lily, if you will tell it us. How old is Dotty,
again? I forget.

LILY. She is not quite three; but she has such odd little old ways, sometimes.

L. And she was very fond of Alice?

LILY. Yes; Alice was so good to her always!

L. And so when Alice went away?

LILY. Oh, it was nothing, you know, to tell about; only it was strange at the time.

L. Well; but I want you to tell it.

LILY. The morning after Alice had gone, Dotty was very sad and restless when she got up; and
went about, looking into all the corners, as if she could find Alice in them, and at last she
came to me, and said, 'Is Alie gone over the great sea?' And I said, 'Yes, she is gone over
the great, deep sea, but she will come back again some day.' Then Dotty looked round the room;
and I had just poured some water out into the basin; and Dotty ran to it, and got up on a chair,
and dashed her hands through the water, again and again; and cried, 'Oh, deep, deep sea! send
little Alie back to me.'

L. Isn't that pretty, children? There's a dear little heathen for you! The whole heart of Greek
mythology is in that; the idea of a personal being in the elemental power;--of its being moved
by prayer;--and of its presence everywhere, making the broken diffusion of the element sacred.

Now, remember, the measure in which we may permit ourselves to think of this trusted and adored
personality, in Greek, or in any other, mythology, as conceivably a shadow of truth, will depend
on the degree in which we hold the Greeks, or other great nations, equal, or inferior, in privilege
and character, to the Jews, or to ourselves. If we believe that the great Father would use
the imagination of the Jew as an instrument by which to exalt and lead him; but the imagination
of the Greek only to degrade and mislead him: if we can suppose that real angels were sent
to minister to the Jews and to punish them; but no angels, or only mocking spectra of angels,
or even devils in the shapes of angels, to lead Lycurgus and Leonidas from desolate cradle
to hopeless grave:--and if we can think that it was only the influence of spectres, or the
teaching of demons, which issued in the making of mothers like Cornelia, and of sons like Cleobis
and Bito, we may, of course, reject the heathen Mythology in our privileged scorn: but, at
least, we are bound to examine strictly by what faults of our own it has come to pass, that
the ministry of real angels among ourselves is occasionally so ineffectual, as to end in the
production of Cornelias who entrust their child-jewels to Charlotte Winsors for the better
keeping of them; and of sons like that one who, the other day, in France, beat his mother to
death with a stick; and was brought in by the jury, 'guilty, with extenuating circumstances.'

MAY. Was that really possible?

L. Yes, my dear. I am not sure that I can lay my hand on the reference to it (and I should
not have said 'the other day'--it was a year or two ago), but you may depend on the fact; and
I could give you many like it, if I chose. There was a murder done in Russia, very lately,
on a traveller. The murderess's little daughter was in the way, and found it out, somehow.
Her mother killed her, too, and put her into the oven. There is a peculiar horror about the
relations between parent and child, which are being now brought about by our variously degraded
forms of European white slavery. Here is one reference, I see, in my notes on that story of
Cleobis and Bito; though I suppose I marked this chiefly for its quaintness, and the beautifully
Christian names of the sons; but it is a good instance of the power of the King of the Valley
of Diamonds[153] among us.

In 'Galignani' of July 21-22, 1862, is reported a trial of a farmer's son in the department
of the Yonne. The father, two years ago, at Malay le Grand, gave up his property to his two
sons, on condition of being maintained by them. Simon fulfilled his agreement, but Pierre would
not. The tribunal of Sens condemns Pierre to pay eighty-four francs a year to his father. Pierre
replies, 'he would rather die than pay it.' Actually, returning home, he throws himself into
the river, and the body is not found till next day.

MARY. But--but--I can't tell what you would have us think. Do you seriously mean that the Greeks
were better than we are; and that their gods were real angels?

L. No, my dear. I mean only that we know, in reality, less than nothing of the dealings of
our Maker with our fellow-men; and can only reason or conjecture safely about them, when we
have sincerely humble thoughts of ourselves and our creeds.

We owe to the Greeks every noble discipline in literature; every radical principle of art;
and every form of convenient beauty in our household furniture and daily occupations of life.
We are unable, ourselves, to make rational use of half that we have received from them: and,
of our own, we have nothing but discoveries in science, and fine mechanical adaptations of
the discovered physical powers. On the other hand, the vice existing among certain classes,
both of the rich and poor, in London, Paris, and Vienna, could have been conceived by a Spartan
or Roman of the heroic ages only as possible in a Tartarus, where fiends were employed to teach,
but not to punish, crime. It little becomes us to speak contemptuously of the religion of races
to whom we stand in such relations; nor do I think any man of modesty or thoughtfulness will
ever speak so of any religion, in which God has allowed one good man to die, trusting.

The more readily we admit the possibility of our own cherished convictions being mixed with
error, the more vital and helpful whatever is right in them will become: and no error is so
conclusively fatal as the idea that God will not allow us to err, though He has allowed all
other men to do so. There may be doubt of the meaning of other visions, but there is none respecting
that of the dream of St. Peter; and you may trust the Rock of the Church's Foundation for true
interpreting, when he learned from it that, 'in every nation, he that feareth God and worketh
righteousness, is accepted with Him.' See that you understand what that righteousness means;
and set hand to it stoutly: you will always measure your neighbors' creed kindly, in proportion
to the substantial fruits of your own. Do not think you will ever get harm by striving to enter
into the faith of others, and to sympathise, in imagination, with the guiding principles of
their lives. So only can you justly love them, or pity them, or praise. By the gracious effort
you will double, treble--nay, indefinitely multiply, at once the pleasure, the reverence, and
the intelligence with which you read: and, believe me, it is wiser and holier, by the fire
of your own faith to kindle the ashes of expired religions, than to let your soul shiver and
stumble among their graves, through the gathering darkness, and communicable cold.

MARY (after some pause). We shall all like reading Greek history so much better after this!
but it has put everything else out of our heads that we wanted to ask.

L. I can tell you one of the things; and I might take credit for generosity in telling you;
but I have a personal reason--Lucilla's verse about the creation.

DORA. Oh, yes--yes; and its 'pain together, until now.'

L. I call you back to that, because I must warn you against an old error of my own. Somewhere
in the fourth volume of 'Modern Painters,' I said that the earth seemed to have passed through
its highest state: and that, after ascending by a series of phases, culminating in its habitation
by man, it seems to be now gradually becoming less fit for that habitation.

MARY. Yes, I remember.

L. I wrote those passages under a very bitter impression of the gradual perishing of beauty
from the loveliest scenes which I knew in the physical world;--not in any doubtful way, such
as I might have attributed to loss of sensation in myself--but by violent and definite physical
action; such as the filling up of the Lac de Chêde by landslips from the Rochers des Fiz;--the
narrowing of the Lake Lucerne by the gaining delta of the stream of the Muotta-Thal, which,
in the course of years, will cut the lake into two, as that of Brientz has been divided from
that of Thun;--the steady diminishing of the glaciers north of the Alps, and still more, of
the sheets of snow on their southern slopes, which supply the refreshing streams of Lombardy:--the
equally steady increase of deadly maremma round Pisa and Venice; and other such phenomena,
quite measurably traceable within the limits even of short life, and unaccompanied, as it seemed,
by redeeming or compensatory agencies. I am still under the same impression respecting the
existing phenomena; but I feel more strongly, every day, that no evidence to be collected within
historical periods can be accepted as any clue to the great tendencies of geological change;
but that the great laws which never fail, and to which all change is subordinate, appear such
as to accomplish a gradual advance to lovelier order, and more calmly, yet more deeply, animated
Rest. Nor has this conviction ever fastened itself upon me more distinctly, than during my
endeavour to trace the laws which govern the lowly framework of the dust. For, through all
the phases of its transition and dissolution, there seems to be a continual effort to raise
itself into a higher state; and a measured gain, through the fierce revulsion and slow renewal
of the earth's frame, in beauty, and order, and permanence. The soft white sediments of the
sea draw themselves, in process of time, into smooth knots of sphered symmetry; burdened and
strained under increase of pressure, they pass into a nascent marble; scorched by fervent heat,
they brighten and blanch into the snowy rock of Paros and Carrara. The dark drift of the inland
river, or stagnant slime of inland pool and lake, divides, or resolves itself as it dries,
into layers of its several elements; slowly purifying each by the patient withdrawal of it
from the anarchy of the mass in which it was mingled. Contracted by increasing drought, till
it must shatter into fragments, it infuses continually a finer ichor into the opening veins,
and finds in its weakness the first rudiments of a perfect strength. Bent at last, rock from
rock, nay, atom from atom, and tormented in lambent fire, it knits, through the fusion, the
fibres of a perennial endurance; and, during countless subsequent centuries, declining, or
rather let me say, rising to repose, finishes the infallible lustre of its crystalline beauty,
under harmonies of law which are wholly beneficent, because wholly inexorable.

     (The children seem pleased, but more inclined to think over
     these matters than to talk.)

L. (after giving them a little time). Mary, I seldom ask you to read anything out of books
of mine; but there is a passage about the Law of Help, which I want you to read to the children
now, because it is of no use merely to put it in other words for them. You know the place I
mean, do not you?

MARY. Yes (presently finding it); where shall I begin?

L. Here; but the elder ones had better look afterwards at the piece which comes just before this.

MARY (reads):

       *       *       *       *       *

'A pure or holy state of anything is that in which all its parts are helpful or consistent.
The highest and first law of the universe, and the other name of life, is therefore, "help."
The other name of death is "separation." Government and co-operation are in all things, and
eternally, the laws of life. Anarchy and competition, eternally, and in all things, the laws
of death.

'Perhaps the best, though the most familiar, example we could take of the nature and power
of consistence, will be that of the possible changes in the dust we tread on.

'Exclusive of animal decay, we can hardly arrive at a more absolute type of impurity, than
the mud or slime of a damp, over-trodden path, in the outskirts of a manufacturing town. I
do not say mud of the road, because that is mixed with animal refuse; but take merely an ounce
or two of the blackest slime of a beaten footpath, on a rainy day, near a manufacturing town.
That slime we shall find in most cases composed of clay (or brickdust, which is burnt clay),
mixed with soot, a little sand and water. All these elements are at helpless war with each
other, and destroy reciprocally each other's nature and power: competing and fighting for place
at every tread of your foot; sand squeezing out clay, and clay squeezing out water, and soot
meddling everywhere, and defiling the whole. Let us suppose that this ounce of mud is left
in perfect rest, and that its elements gather together, like to like, so that their atoms may
get into the closest relations possible.

'Let the clay begin. Ridding itself of all foreign substance, it gradually becomes a white
earth, already very beautiful, and fit, with help of congealing fire, to be made into finest
porcelain, and painted on, and be kept in kings' palaces. But such artificial consistence is
not its best. Leave it still quiet, to follow its own instinct of unity, and it becomes, not
only white but clear; not only clear, but hard; nor only clear and hard, but so set that it
can deal with light in a wonderful way, and gather out of it the loveliest blue rays only,
refusing the rest. We call it then a sapphire.

'Such being the consummation of the clay, we give similar permission of quiet to the sand.
It also becomes, first, a white earth; then proceeds to grow clear and hard, and at last arranges
itself in mysterious, infinitely fine parallel lines, which have the power of reflecting, not
merely the blue rays, but the blue, green, purple, and red rays, in the greatest beauty in
which they can be seen through any hard material whatsoever. We call it then an opal.

'In next order the soot sets to work. It cannot make itself white at first; but, instead of
being discouraged, tries harder and harder; and comes out clear at last; and the hardest thing
in the world: and for the blackness that it had, obtains in exchange the power of reflecting
all the rays of the sun at once, in the vividest blaze that any solid thing can shoot. We call
it then a diamond.

'Last of all, the water purifies, or unites itself; contented enough if it only reach the form
of a dewdrop: but, if we insist on its proceeding to a more perfect consistence, it crystallises
into the shape of a star. And, for the ounce of slime which we had by political economy of
competition, we have, by political economy of co-operation, a sapphire, an opal, and a diamond,
set in the midst of a star of snow.'

       *       *       *       *       *

L. I have asked you to hear that, children, because, from all that we have seen in the work
and play of these past days, I would have you gain at least one grave and enduring thought.
The seeming trouble,--the unquestionable degradation,--of the elements of the physical earth,
must passively wait the appointed time of their repose, or their restoration. It can only be
brought about for them by the agency of external law. But if, indeed, there be a nobler life
in us than in these strangely moving atoms;--if, indeed, there is an eternal difference between
the fire which inhabits them, and that which animates us,--it must be shown, by each of us
in his appointed place, not merely in the patience, but in the activity of our hope; not merely
by our desire, but our labour, for the time when the Dust of the generations of men shall be
confirmed for foundations of the gates of the city of God. The human clay, now trampled and
despised, will not be,--cannot be,--knit into strength and light by accident or ordinances
of unassisted fate. By human cruelty and iniquity it has been afflicted;--by human mercy and
justice it must be raised: and, in all fear or questioning of what is or is not, the real message
of creation, or of revelation, you may assuredly find perfect peace, if you are resolved to
do that which your Lord has plainly required,--and content that He should indeed require no
more of you,--than to do Justice, to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with Him.

'That third pyramid of hers.'

Throughout the dialogues, it must be observed that 'Sibyl' is addressed (when in play) as having
once been the Cumæan Sibyl; and 'Egypt' as having been queen Nitocris,--the Cinderella, and
'the greatest heroine and beauty' of Egyptian story. The Egyptians called her 'Neith the Victorious'
(Nitocris), and the Greeks 'Face of the Rose' (Rhodope). Chaucer's beautiful conception of
Cleopatra in the 'Legend of Good Women,' is much more founded on the traditions of her than
on those of Cleopatra; and, especially in its close, modified by Herodotus's terrible story
of the death of Nitocris, which, however, is mythologically nothing more than a part of the
deep monotonous ancient dirge for the fulfilment of the earthly destiny of Beauty; 'She cast
herself into a chamber full of ashes.'

I believe this Queen is now sufficiently ascertained to have either built, or increased to
double its former size, the third pyramid of Gizeh: and the passage following in the text refers
to an imaginary endeavour, by the Old Lecturer and the children together, to make out the description
of that pyramid in the 167th page of the second volume of Bunsen's 'Egypt's Place in Universal
History'--ideal endeavour,--which ideally terminates as the Old Lecturer's real endeavours
to the same end always have terminated. There are, however, valuable notes respecting Nitocris
at page 210 of the same volume: but the 'Early Egyptian History for the Young,' by the author
of Sidney Gray, contains, in a pleasant form, as much information as young readers will usually
need.

'Pyramid of Asychis.'

This pyramid, in mythology, divides with the Tower of Babel the shame, or vain glory, of being
presumptuously, and first among great edifices, built with 'brick for stone.' This was the
inscription on it, according to Herodotus:--

     'Despise me not, in comparing me with the pyramids of stone;
     for I have the pre-eminence over them, as far as Jupiter has
     pre-eminence over the gods. For, striking with staves into
     the pool, men gathered the clay which fastened itself to the
     staff, and kneaded bricks out of it, and so made me.'

The word I have translated 'kneaded' is literally 'drew;' in the sense of drawing, for which
the Latins used 'duco;' and thus gave us our 'ductile' in speaking of dead clay, and Duke,
Doge, or leader, in speaking of living clay. As the asserted pre-eminence of the edifice is
made, in this inscription, to rest merely on the quantity of labour consumed in it, this pyramid
is considered, in the text, as the type, at once, of the base building, and of the lost labour,
of future ages, so far at least as the spirits of measured and mechanical effort deal with
it: but Neith, exercising her power upon it, makes it a type of the work of wise and inspired
builders.

'The Greater Pthah.'

It is impossible, as yet, to define with distinctness the personal agencies of the Egyptian
deities. They are continually associated in function, or hold derivative powers, or are related
to each other in mysterious triads; uniting always symbolism of physical phenomena with real
spiritual power. I have endeavoured partly to explain this in the text of the tenth Lecture:
here, it is only necessary for the reader to know that the Greater Pthah more or less represents
the formative power of order and measurement: he always stands on a four-square pedestal, 'the
Egyptian cubit, metaphorically used as the hieroglyphic for truth;' his limbs are bound together,
to signify fixed stability, as of a pillar; he has a measuring-rod in his hand; and at Philæ,
is represented as holding an egg on a potter's wheel; but I do not know if this symbol occurs
in older sculptures. His usual title is the 'Lord of Truth.' Others, very beautiful: 'King
of the Two Worlds, of Gracious Countenance,' 'Superintendent of the Great Abode,' &c., are
given by Mr. Birch in Arundale's 'Gallery of Antiquities,' which I suppose is the book of best
authority easily accessible. For the full titles and utterances of the gods, Rosellini is as
yet the only--and I believe, still a very questionable--authority; and Arundale's little book,
excellent in the text, has this great defect, that its drawings give the statues invariably
a ludicrous or ignoble character. Readers who have not access to the originals must be warned
against this frequent fault in modern illustration (especially existing also in some of the
painted casts of Gothic and Norman work at the Crystal Palace). It is not owing to any wilful
want of veracity: the plates in Arundale's book are laboriously faithful: but the expressions
of both face and body in a figure depend merely on emphasis of touch; and, in barbaric art,
most draughtsmen emphasise what they plainly see--the barbarism; and miss conditions of nobleness,
which they must approach the monument in a different temper before they will discover, and
draw with great subtlety before they can express.

The character of the Lower Pthah, or perhaps I ought rather to say, of Pthah in his lower office,
is sufficiently explained in the text of the third Lecture; only the reader must be warned
that the Egyptian symbolism of him by the beetle was not a scornful one; it expressed only
the idea of his presence in the first elements of life. But it may not unjustly be used, in
another sense, by us, who have seen his power in new development; and, even as it was, I cannot
conceive that the Egyptians should have regarded their beetle-headed image of him (Champollion,
'Pantheon,' pl. 12), without some occult scorn. It is the most painful of all their types of
any beneficent power; and even among those of evil influences, none can be compared with it,
except its opposite, the tortoise-headed demon of indolence.

Pasht (p. 24, line 32) is connected with the Greek Artemis, especially in her offices of judgment
and vengeance. She is usually lioness-headed; sometimes cat-headed; her attributes seeming
often trivial or ludicrous unless their full meaning is known; but the enquiry is much too
wide to be followed here. The cat was sacred to her; or rather to the sun, and secondarily
to her. She is alluded to in the text because she is always the companion of Pthah (called
'the beloved of Pthah,' it may be as Judgment, demanded and longed for by Truth); and it may
be well for young readers to have this fixed in their minds, even by chance association. There
are more statues of Pasht in the British Museum than of any other Egyptian deity; several of
them fine in workmanship; nearly all in dark stone, which may be, presumably, to connect her,
as the moon, with the night; and in her office of avenger, with grief.

Thoth (p. 27, line 17), is the Recording Angel of Judgment; and the Greek Hermes Phre (line
20), is the Sun.

Neith is the Egyptian spirit of divine wisdom; and the Athena of the Greeks. No sufficient
statement of her many attributes, still less of their meanings, can be shortly given; but this
should be noted respecting the veiling of the Egyptian image of her by vulture wings--that
as she is, physically, the goddess of the air, this bird, the most powerful creature of the
air known to the Egyptians, naturally became her symbol. It had other significations; but certainly
this, when in connection with Neith. As representing her, it was the most important sign, next
to the winged sphere, in Egyptian sculpture; and, just as in Homer, Athena herself guides her
heroes into battle, this symbol of wisdom, giving victory, floats over the heads of the Egyptian
kings. The Greeks, representing the goddess herself in human form, yet would not lose the power
of the Egyptian symbol, and changed it into an angel of victory. First seen in loveliness on
the early coins of Syracuse and Leontium, it gradually became the received sign of all conquest,
and the so-called 'Victory' of later times; which, little by little, loses its truth, and is
accepted by the moderns only as a personification of victory itself,--not as an actual picture
of the living Angel who led to victory. There is a wide difference between these two conceptions,--all
the difference between insincere poetry, and sincere religion. This I have also endeavoured
farther to illustrate in the tenth Lecture; there is however one part of Athena's character
which it would have been irrelevant to dwell upon there; yet which I must not wholly leave
unnoticed.

As the goddess of the air, she physically represents both its beneficent calm, and necessary
tempest: other storm-deities (as Chrysaor and Æolus) being invested with a subordinate and
more or less malignant function, which is exclusively their own, and is related to that of
Athena as the power of Mars is related to hers in war. So also Virgil makes her able to wield
the lightning herself, while Juno cannot, but must pray for the intervention of Æolus. She
has precisely the correspondent moral authority over calmness of mind, and just anger. She
soothes Achilles, as she incites Tydides; her physical power over the air being always hinted
correlatively. She grasps Achilles by his hair--as the wind would lift it--softly,

    'It fanned his cheek, it raised his hair,
    Like a meadow gale in spring.'

She does not merely turn the lance of Mars from Diomed; but seizes it in both her hands, and
casts it aside, with a sense of making it vain, like chaff in the wind;--to the shout of Achilles,
she adds her own voice of storm in heaven--but in all cases the moral power is still the principal
one--most beautifully in that seizing of Achilles by the hair, which was the talisman of his
life (because he had vowed it to the Sperchius if he returned in safety), and which, in giving
at Patroclus' tomb, he, knowingly, yields up the hope of return to his country, and signifies
that he will die with his friend. Achilles and Tydides are, above all other heroes, aided by
her in war, because their prevailing characters are the desire of justice, united in both with
deep affections; and, in Achilles, with a passionate tenderness, which is the real root of
his passionate anger. Ulysses is her favourite chiefly in her office as the goddess of conduct
and design.

'Geometrical limitations.'

It is difficult, without a tedious accuracy, or without full illustration, to express the complete
relations of crystalline structure, which dispose minerals to take, at different times, fibrous,
massive, or foliated forms; and I am afraid this chapter will be generally skipped by the reader:
yet the arrangement itself will be found useful, if kept broadly in mind; and the transitions
of state are of the highest interest, if the subject is entered upon with any earnestness.
It would have been vain to add to the scheme of this little volume any account of the geometrical
forms of crystals: an available one, though still far too difficult and too copious, has been
arranged by the Rev. Mr. Mitchell, for Orr's 'Circle of the Sciences'; and, I believe, the
'nets' of crystals, which are therein given to be cut out with scissors and put prettily together,
will be found more conquerable by young ladies than by other students. They should also, when
an opportunity occurs, be shown, at any public library, the diagram of the crystallisation
of quartz referred to poles, at p. 8 of Cloizaux's 'Manuel de Minéralogie': that they may know
what work is; and what the subject is.

With a view to more careful examination of the nascent states of silica, I have made no allusion
in this volume to the influence of mere segregation, as connected with the crystalline power.
It has only been recently, during the study of the breccias alluded to in page 113, that I
have fully seen the extent to which this singular force often modifies rocks in which at first
its influence might hardly have been suspected; many apparent conglomerates being in reality
formed chiefly by segregation, combined with mysterious brokenly-zoned structures, like those
of some malachites. I hope some day to know more of these and several other mineral phenomena
(especially of those connected with the relative sizes of crystals), which otherwise I should
have endeavoured to describe in this volume.

'St. Barbara.'

I would have given the legends of St. Barbara, and St. Thomas, if I had thought it always well
for young readers to have everything at once told them which they may wish to know. They will
remember the stories better after taking some trouble to find them: and the text is intelligible
enough as it stands. The idea of St. Barbara, as there given is founded partly on her legend
in Peter de Natalibus, partly on the beautiful photograph of Van Eyck's picture of her at Antwerp:
which was some time since published at Lille.

'King of the Valley of Diamonds.'

Isabel interrupted the Lecturer here, and was briefly bid to hold her tongue; which gave rise
to some talk, apart, afterwards, between L. and Sibyl, of which a word or two may be perhaps
advisably set down.

SIBYL. We shall spoil Isabel, certainly, if we don't mind: I was glad you stopped her, and
yet sorry; for she wanted so much to ask about the Valley of Diamonds again, and she has worked
so hard at it, and made it nearly all out by herself. She recollected Elisha's throwing in
the meal, which nobody else did.

L. But what did she want to ask?

SIBYL. About the mulberry trees and the serpents; we are all stopped by that. Won't you tell
us what it means?

L. Now, Sibyl, I am sure you, who never explained yourself, should be the last to expect others
to do so. I hate explaining myself.

SIBYL. And yet how often you complain of other people for not saying what they meant. How I
have heard you growl over the three stone steps to purgatory; for instance!

L. Yes; because Dante's meaning is worth getting at; but mine matters nothing: at least, if
ever I think it is of any consequence, I speak it as clearly as may be. But you may make anything
you like of the serpent forests. I could have helped you to find out what they were, by giving
a little more detail, but it would have been tiresome.

SIBYL. It is much more tiresome not to find out. Tell us, please, as Isabel says, because we
feel so stupid.

L. There is no stupidity; you could not possibly do more than guess at anything so vague. But
I think, you, Sibyl, at least, might have recollected what first dyed the mulberry?

SIBYL. So I did; but that helped little; I thought of Dante's forest of suicides, too, but
you would not simply have borrowed that?

L. No. If I had had strength to use it, I should have stolen it, to beat into another shape;
not borrowed it. But that idea of souls in trees is as old as the world; or at least, as the
world of man. And I did mean that there were souls in those dark branches; the souls of all
those who had perished in misery through the pursuit of riches; and that the river was of their
blood, gathering gradually, and flowing out of the valley. That I meant the serpents for the
souls of those who had lived carelessly and wantonly in their riches; and who have all their
sins forgiven by the world, because they are rich: and therefore they have seven crimson crested
heads, for the seven mortal sins; of which they are proud: and these, and the memory and report
of them, are the chief causes of temptation to others, as showing the pleasantness and absolving
power of riches; so that thus they are singing serpents. And the worms are the souls of the
common money-getters and traffickers, who do nothing but eat and spin: and who gain habitually
by the distress or foolishness of others (as you see the butchers have been gaining out of
the panic at the cattle plague, among the poor),--so they are made to eat the dark leaves,
and spin, and perish.

SIBYL. And the souls of the great, cruel, rich people who oppress the poor, and lend money
to government to make unjust war, where are they?

L. They change into the ice, I believe, and are knit with the gold; and make the grave dust
of the valley. I believe so, at least, for no one ever sees those souls anywhere.

     (SIBYL ceases questioning.)

ISABEL (who has crept up to her side without any one's seeing). Oh, Sibyl, please ask him about
the fire-flies!

L. What, you there, mousie! No; I won't tell either Sibyl or you about the fire-flies; nor
a word more about anything else. You ought to be little fire-flies yourselves, and find your
way in twilight by your own wits.

ISABEL. But you said they burned, you know?

L. Yes; and you may be fire-flies that way too, some of you, before long, though I did not
mean that. Away with you, children. You have thought enough for to-day.

NOTE TO SECOND EDITION.

Sentence out of letter from May (who is staying with Isabel just now at Cassel), dated 15th
June, 1877:--

"I am reading the Ethics with a nice Irish girl who is staying here, and she's just as puzzled
as I've always been about the fire-flies, and we both want to know so much.--Please be a very
nice old Lecturer, and tell us, won't you?"

Well, May, you never were a vain girl; so could scarcely guess that I meant them for the light,
unpursued vanities, which yet blind us, confused among the stars. One evening, as I came late
into Siena, the fire-flies were flying high on a stormy sirocco wind,--the stars themselves
no brighter, and all their host seeming, at moments, to fade as the insects faded.

FICTION--FAIR AND FOUL.

On the first mild--or, at least, the first bright--day of March, in this year, I walked through
what was once a country lane, between the hostelry of the Half-moon at the bottom of Herne
Hill, and the secluded College of Dulwich.

In my young days, Croxsted Lane was a green bye-road traversable for some distance by carts;
but rarely so traversed, and, for the most part, little else than a narrow strip of untilled
field, separated by blackberry hedges from the better cared-for meadows on each side of it:
growing more weeds, therefore, than they, and perhaps in spring a primrose or two--white archangel--daisies
plenty, and purple thistles in autumn. A slender rivulet, boasting little of its brightness,
for there are no springs at Dulwich, yet fed purely enough by the rain and morning dew, here
trickled--there loitered--through the long grass beneath the hedges, and expanded itself, where
it might, into moderately clear and deep pools, in which, under their veils of duck-weed, a
fresh-water shell or two, sundry curious little skipping shrimps, any quantity of tadpoles
in their time, and even sometimes a tittlebat, offered themselves to my boyhood's pleased,
and not inaccurate, observation. There, my mother and I used to gather the first buds of the
hawthorn; and there, in after years, I used to walk in the summer shadows, as in a place wilder
and sweeter than our garden, to think over any passage I wanted to make better than usual in
Modern Painters.

So, as aforesaid, on the first kindly day of this year, being thoughtful more than usual of
those old times, I went to look again at the place.

Often, both in those days, and since, I have put myself hard to it, vainly, to find words wherewith
to tell of beautiful things; but beauty has been in the world since the world was made, and
human language can make a shift, somehow, to give account of it, whereas the peculiar forces
of devastation induced by modern city life have only entered the world lately; and no existing
terms of language known to me are enough to describe the forms of filth, and modes of ruin,
that varied themselves along the course of Croxsted Lane. The fields on each side of it are
now mostly dug up for building, or cut through into gaunt corners and nooks of blind ground
by the wild crossings and concurrencies of three railroads. Half a dozen handfuls of new cottages,
with Doric doors, are dropped about here and there among the gashed ground: the lane itself,
now entirely grassless, is a deep-rutted, heavy-hillocked cart-road, diverging gatelessly into
various brick-fields or pieces of waste; and bordered on each side by heaps of--Hades only
knows what!--mixed dust of every unclean thing that can crumble in drought, and mildew of every
unclean thing that can rot or rust in damp: ashes and rags, beer-bottles and old shoes, battered
pans, smashed crockery, shreds of nameless clothes, door-sweepings, floor-sweepings, kitchen
garbage, back-garden sewage, old iron, rotten timber jagged with out-torn nails, cigar-ends,
pipe-bowls, cinders, bones, and ordure, indescribable; and, variously kneaded into, sticking
to, or fluttering foully here and there over all these,--remnants broadcast, of every manner
of newspaper, advertisement or big-lettered bill, festering and flaunting out their last publicity
in the pits of stinking dust and mortal slime.

The lane ends now where its prettiest windings once began; being cut off by a cross-road leading
out of Dulwich to a minor railway station: and on the other side of this road, what was of
old the daintiest intricacy of its solitude is changed into a straight, and evenly macadamised
carriage drive, between new houses of extreme respectability, with good attached gardens and
offices--most of these tenements being larger--all more pretentious, and many, I imagine, held
at greatly higher rent than my father's, tenanted for twenty years at Herne Hill. And it became
matter of curious meditation to me what must here become of children resembling my poor little
dreamy quondam self in temper, and thus brought up at the same distance from London, and in
the same or better circumstances of worldly fortune; but with only Croxsted Lane in its present
condition for their country walk. The trimly kept road before their doors, such as one used
to see in the fashionable suburbs of Cheltenham or Leamington, presents nothing to their study
but gravel, and gas-lamp posts; the modern addition of a vermilion letter-pillar contributing
indeed to the splendour, but scarcely to the interest of the scene; and a child of any sense
or fancy would hastily contrive escape from such a barren desert of politeness, and betake
itself to investigation, such as might be feasible, of the natural history of Croxsted Lane.

But, for its sense or fancy, what food, or stimulus, can it find, in that foul causeway of
its youthful pilgrimage? What would have happened to myself, so directed, I cannot clearly
imagine. Possibly, I might have got interested in the old iron and wood-shavings; and become
an engineer or a carpenter: but for the children of to-day, accustomed from the instant they
are out of their cradles, to the sight of this infinite nastiness, prevailing as a fixed condition
of the universe, over the face of nature, and accompanying all the operations of industrious
man, what is to be the scholastic issue? unless, indeed, the thrill of scientific vanity in
the primary analysis of some unheard-of process of corruption--or the reward of microscopic
research in the sight of worms with more legs, and acari of more curious generation than ever
vivified the more simply smelling plasma of antiquity.

One result of such elementary education is, however, already certain; namely, that the pleasure
which we may conceive taken by the children of the coming time, in the analysis of physical
corruption, guides, into fields more dangerous and desolate, the expatiation of imaginative
literature: and that the reactions of moral disease upon itself, and the conditions of languidly
monstrous character developed in an atmosphere of low vitality, have become the most valued
material of modern fiction, and the most eagerly discussed texts of modern philosophy.

The many concurrent reasons for this mischief may, I believe, be massed under a few general heads.

I. There is first the hot fermentation and unwholesome secrecy of the population crowded into
large cities, each mote in the misery lighter, as an individual soul, than a dead leaf, but
becoming oppressive and infectious each to his neighbour, in the smoking mass of decay. The
resulting modes of mental ruin and distress are continually new; and in a certain sense, worth
study in their monstrosity: they have accordingly developed a corresponding science of fiction,
concerned mainly with the description of such forms of disease, like the botany of leaf-lichens.

In De Balzac's story of Father Goriot, a grocer makes a large fortune, of which he spends on
himself as much as may keep him alive; and on his two daughters, all that can promote their
pleasures or their pride. He marries them to men of rank, supplies their secret expenses, and
provides for his favourite a separate and clandestine establishment with her lover. On his
deathbed, he sends for this favourite daughter, who wishes to come, and hesitates for a quarter
of an hour between doing so, and going to a ball at which it has been for the last month her
chief ambition to be seen. She finally goes to the ball.

This story is, of course, one of which the violent contrasts and spectral catastrophe could
only take place, or be conceived, in a large city. A village grocer cannot make a large fortune,
cannot marry his daughters to titled squires, and cannot die without having his children brought
to him, if in the neighbourhood, by fear of village gossip, if for no better cause.

II. But a much more profound feeling than this mere curiosity of science in morbid phenomena
is concerned in the production of the carefullest forms of modern fiction. The disgrace and
grief resulting from the mere trampling pressure and electric friction of town life, become
to the sufferers peculiarly mysterious in their undeservedness, and frightful in their inevitableness.
The power of all surroundings over them for evil; the incapacity of their own minds to refuse
the pollution, and of their own wills to oppose the weight, of the staggering mass that chokes
and crushes them into perdition, brings every law of healthy existence into question with them,
and every alleged method of help and hope into doubt. Indignation, without any calming faith
in justice, and self-contempt, without any curative self-reproach, dull the intelligence, and
degrade the conscience, into sullen incredulity of all sunshine outside the dunghill, or breeze
beyond the wafting of its impurity; and at last a philosophy develops itself, partly satiric,
partly consolatory, concerned only with the regenerative vigour of manure, and the necessary
obscurities of fimetic Providence; showing how everybody's fault is somebody else's, how infection
has no law, digestion no will, and profitable dirt no dishonour.

And thus an elaborate and ingenious scholasticism, in what may be called the Divinity of Decomposition,
has established itself in connection with the more recent forms of romance, giving them at
once a complacent tone of clerical dignity, and an agreeable dash of heretical impudence; while
the inculcated doctrine has the double advantage of needing no laborious scholarship for its
foundation, and no painful self-denial for its practice.

III. The monotony of life in the central streets of any great modern city, but especially in
those of London, where every emotion intended to be derived by men from the sight of nature,
or the sense of art, is forbidden for ever, leaves the craving of the heart for a sincere,
yet changeful, interest, to be fed from one source only. Under natural conditions the degree
of mental excitement necessary to bodily health is provided by the course of the seasons, and
the various skill and fortune of agriculture. In the country every morning of the year brings
with it a new aspect of springing or fading nature; a new duty to be fulfilled upon earth,
and a new promise or warning in heaven. No day is without its innocent hope, its special prudence,
its kindly gift, and its sublime danger; and in every process of wise husbandry, and every
effort of contending or remedial courage, the wholesome passions, pride, and bodily power of
the labourer are excited and exerted in happiest unison. The companionship of domestic, the
care of serviceable, animals, soften and enlarge his life with lowly charities, and discipline
him in familiar wisdoms and unboastful fortitudes; while the divine laws of seed-time which
cannot be recalled, harvest which cannot be hastened, and winter in which no man can work,
compel the impatiences and coveting of his heart into labour too submissive to be anxious,
and rest too sweet to be wanton. What thought can enough comprehend the contrast between such
life, and that in streets where summer and winter are only alternations of heat and cold; where
snow never fell white, nor sunshine clear; where the ground is only a pavement, and the sky
no more than the glass roof of an arcade; where the utmost power of a storm is to choke the
gutters, and the finest magic of spring, to change mud into dust: where--chief and most fatal
difference in state, there is no interest of occupation for any of the inhabitants but the
routine of counter or desk within doors, and the effort to pass each other without collision
outside; so that from morning to evening the only possible variation of the monotony of the
hours, and lightening of the penalty of existence, must be some kind of mischief, limited,
unless by more than ordinary godsend of fatality, to the fall of a horse, or the slitting of
a pocket.

I said that under these laws of inanition, the craving of the human heart for some kind of
excitement could be supplied from one source only. It might have been thought by any other
than a sternly tentative philosopher, that the denial of their natural food to human feelings
would have provoked a reactionary desire for it; and that the dreariness of the street would
have been gilded by dreams of pastoral felicity. Experience has shown the fact to be otherwise;
the thoroughly trained Londoner can enjoy no other excitement than that to which he has been
accustomed, but asks for that in continually more ardent or more virulent concentration; and
the ultimate power of fiction to entertain him is by varying to his fancy the modes, and defining
for his dulness the horrors, of Death. In the single novel of Bleak House there are nine deaths
(or left for death's, in the drop scene) carefully wrought out or led up to, either by way
of pleasing surprise, as the baby's at the brickmaker's, or finished in their threatenings
and sufferings, with as much enjoyment as can be contrived in the anticipation, and as much
pathology as can be concentrated in the description. Under the following varieties of method:--

    One by assassination                  Mr. Tulkinghorn.
    One by starvation, with phthisis      Joe.
    One by chagrin                        Richard.
    One by spontaneous combustion         Mr. Krook.
    One by sorrow                         Lady Dedlock's lover.
    One by remorse                        Lady Dedlock.
    One by insanity                       Miss Flite.
    One by paralysis                      Sir Leicester.

Besides the baby, by fever, and a lively young Frenchwoman left to be hanged.

And all this, observe, not in a tragic, adventurous, or military story, but merely as the further
enlivenment of a narrative intended to be amusing; and as a properly representative average
of the statistics of civilian mortality in the centre of London.

Observe further, and chiefly. It is not the mere number of deaths (which, if we count the odd
troopers in the last scene, is exceeded in Old Mortality, and reached, within one or two, both
in Waverley and Guy Mannering) that marks the peculiar tone of the modern novel. It is the
fact that all these deaths, but one, are of inoffensive, or at least in the world's estimate
respectable persons; and that they are all grotesquely either violent or miserable, purporting
thus to illustrate the modern theology that the appointed destiny of a large average of our
population is to die like rats in a drain, either by trap or poison. Not, indeed, that a lawyer
in full practice can be usually supposed as faultless in the eye of heaven as a dove or a woodcock;
but it is not, in former divinities, thought the will of Providence that he should be dropped
by a shot from a client behind his fire-screen, and retrieved in the morning by his housemaid
under the chandelier. Neither is Lady Dedlock less reprehensible in her conduct than many women
of fashion have been and will be: but it would not therefore have been thought poetically just,
in old-fashioned morality, that she should be found by her daughter lying dead, with her face
in the mud of a St. Giles's churchyard.

In the work of the great masters death is always either heroic, deserved, or quiet and natural
(unless their purpose be totally and deeply tragic, when collateral meaner death is permitted,
like that of Polonius or Roderigo). In Old Mortality, four of the deaths, Bothwell's, Ensign
Grahame's, Macbriar's, and Evandale's, are magnificently heroic; Burley's and Oliphant's long
deserved, and swift; the troopers', met in the discharge of their military duty, and the old
miser's, as gentle as the passing of a cloud, and almost beautiful in its last words of--now
unselfish--care.

     'Ailie' (he aye ca'd me Ailie, we were auld acquaintance,)
     'Ailie, take ye care and haud the gear weel thegither; for
     the name of Morton of Milnwood's gane out like the last
     sough of an auld sang.' And sae he fell out o' ae dwam into
     another, and ne'er spak a word mair, unless it were
     something we cou'dna mak out, about a dipped candle being
     gude eneugh to see to dee wi'. He cou'd ne'er bide to see a
     moulded ane, and there was ane, by ill luck, on the table.

In Guy Mannering, the murder, though unpremeditated, of a single person, (himself not entirely
innocent, but at least by heartlessness in a cruel function earning his fate,) is avenged to
the uttermost on all the men conscious of the crime; Mr. Bertram's death, like that of his
wife, brief in pain, and each told in the space of half-a-dozen lines; and that of the heroine
of the tale, self-devoted, heroic in the highest, and happy.

Nor is it ever to be forgotten, in the comparison of Scott's with inferior work, that his own
splendid powers were, even in early life, tainted, and in his latter years destroyed, by modern
conditions of commercial excitement, then first, but rapidly, developing themselves. There
are parts even in his best novels coloured to meet tastes which he despised; and many pages
written in his later ones to lengthen his article for the indiscriminate market.

But there was one weakness of which his healthy mind remained incapable to the last. In modern
stories prepared for more refined or fastidious audiences than those of Dickens, the funereal
excitement is obtained, for the most part, not by the infliction of violent or disgusting death;
but in the suspense, the pathos, and the more or less by all felt, and recognised, mortal phenomena
of the sick-room. The temptation, to weak writers, of this order of subject is especially great,
because the study of it from the living--or dying--model is so easy, and to many has been the
most impressive part of their own personal experience; while, if the description be given even
with mediocre accuracy, a very large section of readers will admire its truth, and cherish
its melancholy: Few authors of second or third rate genius can either record or invent a probable
conversation in ordinary life; but few, on the other hand, are so destitute of observant faculty
as to be unable to chronicle the broken syllables and languid movements of an invalid. The
easily rendered, and too surely recognised, image of familiar suffering is felt at once to
be real where all else had been false; and the historian of the gestures of fever and words
of delirium can count on the applause of a gratified audience as surely as the dramatist who
introduces on the stage of his flagging action a carriage that can be driven or a fountain
that will flow. But the masters of strong imagination disdain such work, and those of deep
sensibility shrink from it.[154] Only under conditions of personal weakness, presently to be
noted, would Scott comply with the cravings of his lower audience in scenes of terror like
the death of Front-de-Boeuf. But he never once withdrew the sacred curtain of the sick-chamber,
nor permitted the disgrace of wanton tears round the humiliation of strength, or the wreck
of beauty.

IV. No exception to this law of reverence will be found in the scenes in Coeur de Lion's illness
introductory to the principal incident in the Talisman. An inferior writer would have made
the king charge in imagination at the head of his chivalry, or wander in dreams by the brooks
of Aquitaine; but Scott allows us to learn no more startling symptoms of the king's malady
than that he was restless and impatient, and could not wear his armour. Nor is any bodily weakness,
or crisis of danger, permitted to disturb for an instant the royalty of intelligence and heart
in which he examines, trusts and obeys the physician whom his attendants fear.

Yet the choice of the main subject in this story and its companion--the trial, to a point of
utter torture, of knightly faith, and several passages in the conduct of both, more especially
the exaggerated scenes in the House of Baldringham, and hermitage of Engedi, are signs of the
gradual decline in force of intellect and soul which those who love Scott best have done him
the worst injustice in their endeavours to disguise or deny. The mean anxieties, moral humiliations,
and mercilessly demanded brain-toil, which killed him, show their sepulchral grasp for many
and many a year before their final victory; and the states of more or less dulled, distorted,
and polluted imagination which culminate in Castle Dangerous, cast a Stygian hue over St. Ronan's
Well, The Fair Maid of Perth, and Anne of Geierstein, which lowers them, the first altogether,
the other two at frequent intervals, into fellowship with the normal disease which festers
throughout the whole body of our lower fictitious literature.

Fictitious! I use the ambiguous word deliberately; for it is impossible to distinguish in these
tales of the prison-house how far their vice and gloom are thrown into their manufacture only
to meet a vile demand, and how far they are an integral condition of thought in the minds of
men trained from their youth up in the knowledge of Londinian and Parisian misery. The speciality
of the plague is a delight in the exposition of the relations between guilt and decrepitude;
and I call the results of it literature 'of the prison-house,' because the thwarted habits
of body and mind, which are the punishment of reckless crowding in cities, become, in the issue
of that punishment, frightful subjects of exclusive interest to themselves; and the art of
fiction in which they finally delight is only the more studied arrangement and illustration,
by coloured firelights, of the daily bulletins of their own wretchedness, in the prison calendar,
the police news, and the hospital report.

The reader will perhaps be surprised at my separating the greatest work of Dickens, Oliver
Twist, with honour, from the loathsome mass to which it typically belongs. That book is an
earnest and uncaricatured record of states of criminal life, written with didactic purpose,
full of the gravest instruction, nor destitute of pathetic studies of noble passion. Even the
Mysteries of Paris and Gaboriau's Crime d'Augival are raised, by their definiteness of historical
intention and forewarning anxiety, far above the level of their order, and may be accepted
as photographic evidence of an otherwise incredible civilisation, corrupted in the infernal
fact of it, down to the genesis of such figures as the Vicomte d'Augival, the Stabber,[155]
the Skeleton, and the She-wolf. But the effectual head of the whole cretinous school is the
renowned novel in which the hunchbacked lover watches the execution of his mistress from the
tower of Notre-Dame; and its strength passes gradually away into the anatomical preparations,
for the general market, of novels like Poor Miss Finch, in which the heroine is blind, the
hero epileptic, and the obnoxious brother is found dead with his hands dropped off, in the
Arctic regions.[156]

This literature of the Prison-house, understanding by the word not only the cell of Newgate,
but also and even more definitely the cell of the Hôtel-Dieu, the Hôpital des Fous, and the
grated corridor with the dripping slabs of the Morgue, having its central root thus in the
Ile de Paris--or historically and pre-eminently the 'Cité de Paris'--is, when understood deeply,
the precise counter-corruption of the religion of the Sainte Chapelle, just as the worst forms
of bodily and mental ruin are the corruption of love. I have therefore called it 'Fiction mécroyante,'
with literal accuracy and precision; according to the explanation of the word which the reader
may find in any good French dictionary,[157] and round its Arctic pole in the Morgue, he may
gather into one Caina of gelid putrescence the entire product of modern infidel imagination,
amusing itself with destruction of the body, and busying itself with aberration of the mind.

Aberration, palsy, or plague, observe, as distinguished from normal evil, just as the venom
of rabies or cholera differs from that of a wasp or a viper. The life of the insect and serpent
deserves, or at least permits, our thoughts; not so, the stages of agony in the fury-driven
hound. There is some excuse, indeed, for the pathologic labour of the modern novelist in the
fact that he cannot easily, in a city population, find a healthy mind to vivisect: but the
greater part of such amateur surgery is the struggle, in an epoch of wild literary competition,
to obtain novelty of material. The varieties of aspect and colour in healthy fruit, be it sweet
or sour, may be within certain limits described exhaustively. Not so the blotches of its conceivable
blight: and while the symmetries of integral human character can only be traced by harmonious
and tender skill, like the branches of a living tree, the faults and gaps of one gnawed away
by corroding accident can be shuffled into senseless change like the wards of a Chubb lock.

V. It is needless to insist on the vast field for this dice-cast or card-dealt calamity which
opens itself in the ignorance, money-interest, and mean passion, of city marriage. Peasants
know each other as children--meet, as they grow up in testing labour; and if a stout farmer's
son marries a handless girl, it is his own fault. Also in the patrician families of the field,
the young people know what they are doing, and marry a neighbouring estate, or a covetable
title, with some conception of the responsibilities they undertake. But even among these, their
season in the confused metropolis creates licentious and fortuitous temptation before unknown;
and in the lower middle orders, an entirely new kingdom of discomfort and disgrace has been
preached to them in the doctrines of unbridled pleasure which are merely an apology for their
peculiar forms of illbreeding. It is quite curious how often the catastrophe, or the leading
interest, of a modern novel, turns upon the want, both in maid and bachelor, of the common
self-command which was taught to their grandmothers and grandfathers as the first element of
ordinarily decent behaviour. Rashly inquiring the other day the plot of a modern story from
a female friend, I elicited, after some hesitation, that it hinged mainly on the young people's
'forgetting themselves in a boat;' and I perceive it to be accepted as nearly an axiom in the
code of modern civic chivalry that the strength of amiable sentiment is proved by our incapacity
on proper occasions to express, and on improper ones to control it. The pride of a gentleman
of the old school used to be in his power of saying what he meant, and being silent when he
ought, (not to speak of the higher nobleness which bestowed love where it was honourable, and
reverence where it was due); but the automatic amours and involuntary proposals of recent romance
acknowledge little further law of morality than the instinct of an insect, or the effervescence
of a chemical mixture.

There is a pretty little story of Alfred de Musset's,--La Mouche, which, if the reader cares
to glance at it, will save me further trouble in explaining the disciplinarian authority of
mere old-fashioned politeness, as in some sort protective of higher things. It describes, with
much grace and precision, a state of society by no means pre-eminently virtuous, or enthusiastically
heroic; in which many people do extremely wrong, and none sublimely right. But as there are
heights of which the achievement is unattempted, there are abysses to which fall is barred;
neither accident nor temptation will make any of the principal personages swerve from an adopted
resolution, or violate an accepted principle of honour; people are expected as a matter of
course to speak with propriety on occasion, and to wait with patience when they are bid: those
who do wrong, admit it; those who do right don't boast of it; everybody knows his own mind,
and everybody has good manners.

Nor must it be forgotten that in the worst days of the self-indulgence which destroyed the
aristocracies of Europe, their vices, however licentious, were never, in the fatal modern sense,
'unprincipled.' The vainest believed in virtue; the vilest respected it. 'Chaque chose avait
son nom,'[158] and the severest of English moralists recognises the accurate wit, the lofty
intellect, and the unfretted benevolence, which redeemed from vitiated surroundings the circle
of d'Alembert and Marmontel.[159]

I have said, with too slight praise, that the vainest, in those days, 'believed' in virtue.
Beautiful and heroic examples of it were always before them; nor was it without the secret
significance attaching to what may seem the least accidents in the work of a master, that Scott
gave to both his heroines of the age of revolution in England the name of the queen of the
highest order of English chivalry.[160]

It is to say little for the types of youth and maid which alone Scott felt it a joy to imagine,
or thought it honourable to portray, that they act and feel in a sphere where they are never
for an instant liable to any of the weaknesses which disturb the calm, or shake the resolution,
of chastity and courage in a modern novel. Scott lived in a country and time, when, from highest
to lowest, but chiefly in that dignified and nobly severe[161] middle class to which he himself
belonged, a habit of serene and stainless thought was as natural to the people as their mountain
air. Women like Rose Bradwardine and Ailie Dinmont were the grace and guard of almost every
household (God be praised that the race of them is not yet extinct, for all that Mall or Boulevard
can do), and it has perhaps escaped the notice of even attentive readers that the comparatively
uninteresting character of Sir Walter's heroes had always been studied among a class of youths
who were simply incapable of doing anything seriously wrong; and could only be embarrassed
by the consequences of their levity or imprudence.

But there is another difference in the woof of a Waverley novel from the cobweb of a modern
one, which depends on Scott's larger view of human life. Marriage is by no means, in his conception
of man and woman, the most important business of their existence;[162] nor love the only reward
to be proposed to their virtue or exertion. It is not in his reading of the laws of Providence
a necessity that virtue should, either by love or any other external blessing, be rewarded
at all;[163] and marriage is in all cases thought of as a constituent of the happiness of life,
but not as its only interest, still less its only aim. And upon analysing with some care the
motives of his principal stories, we shall often find that the love in them is merely a light
by which the sterner features of character are to be irradiated, and that the marriage of the
hero is as subordinate to the main bent of the story as Henry the Fifth's courtship of Katherine
is to the battle of Agincourt. Nay, the fortunes of the person who is nominally the subject
of the tale are often little more than a background on which grander figures are to be drawn,
and deeper fates forth-shadowed. The judgments between the faith and chivalry of Scotland at
Drumclog and Bothwell bridge owe little of their interest in the mind of a sensible reader
to the fact that the captain of the Popinjay is carried a prisoner to one battle, and returns
a prisoner from the other: and Scott himself, while he watches the white sail that bears Queen
Mary for the last time from her native land, very nearly forgets to finish his novel, or to
tell us--and with small sense of any consolation to be had out of that minor circumstance,--that
'Roland and Catherine were united, spite of their differing faiths.'

Neither let it be thought for an instant that the slight, and sometimes scornful, glance with
which Scott passes over scenes which a novelist of our own day would have analysed with the
airs of a philosopher, and painted with the curiosity of a gossip, indicate any absence in
his heart of sympathy with the great and sacred elements of personal happiness. An era like
ours, which has with diligence and ostentation swept its heart clear of all the passions once
known as loyalty, patriotism, and piety, necessarily magnifies the apparent force of the one
remaining sentiment which sighs through the barren chambers, or clings inextricably round the
chasms of ruin; nor can it but regard with awe the unconquerable spirit which still tempts
or betrays the sagacities of selfishness into error or frenzy which is believed to be love.

That Scott was never himself, in the sense of the phrase as employed by lovers of the Parisian
school, 'ivre d'amour,' may be admitted without prejudice to his sensibility,[164] and that
he never knew 'l'amor che move 'l sol e l'altre stelle,' was the chief, though unrecognised,
calamity of his deeply chequered life. But the reader of honour and feeling will not therefore
suppose that the love which Miss Vernon sacrifices, stooping for an instant from her horse,
is of less noble stamp, or less enduring faith, than that which troubles and degrades the whole
existence of Consuelo; or that the affection of Jeanie Deans for the companion of her childhood,
drawn like a field of soft blue heaven beyond the cloudy wrack of her sorrow, is less fully
in possession of her soul than the hesitating and self-reproachful impulses under which a modern
heroine forgets herself in a boat, or compromises herself in the cool of the evening.

I do not wish to return over the waste ground we have traversed, comparing, point by point,
Scott's manner with those of Bermondsey and the Faubourgs; but it may be, perhaps, interesting
at this moment to examine, with illustration from those Waverley novels which have so lately
retracted the attention of a fair and gentle public, the universal conditions of 'style,' rightly
so called, which are in all ages, and above all local currents or wavering tides of temporary
manners, pillars of what is for ever strong, and models of what is for ever fair.

But I must first define, and that within strict horizon, the works of Scott, in which his perfect
mind may be known, and his chosen ways understood.

His great works of prose fiction, excepting only the first half-volume of Waverley, were all
written in twelve years, 1814-26 (of his own age forty-three to fifty-five), the actual time
employed in their composition being not more than a couple of months out of each year; and
during that time only the morning hours and spare minutes during the professional day. 'Though
the first volume of Waverley was begun long ago, and actually lost for a time, yet the other
two were begun and finished between the 4th of June and the first of July, during all which
I attended my duty in court, and proceeded without loss of time or hindrance of business.'[165]

Few of the maxims for the enforcement of which, in Modern Painters, long ago, I got the general
character of a lover of paradox, are more singular, or more sure, than the statement, apparently
so encouraging to the idle, that if a great thing can be done at all, it can be done easily.
But it is in that kind of ease with which a tree blossoms after long years of gathered strength,
and all Scott's great writings were the recreations of a mind confirmed in dutiful labour,
and rich with organic gathering of boundless resource.

Omitting from our count the two minor and ill-finished sketches of the Black Dwarf and Legend
of Montrose, and, for a reason presently to be noticed, the unhappy St. Ronan's, the memorable
romances of Scott are eighteen, falling into three distinct groups, containing six each.

The first group is distinguished from the other two by characters of strength and felicity
which never more appeared after Scott was struck down by his terrific illness in 1819. It includes
Waverley, Guy Mannering, The Antiquary, Rob Roy, Old Mortality, and The Heart of Midlothian.

The composition of these occupied the mornings of his happiest days, between the ages of 43
and 48. On the 8th of April, 1819 (he was 48 on the preceding 15th of August) he began for
the first time to dictate--being unable for the exertion of writing--The Bride of Lammermuir,
'the affectionate Laidlaw beseeching him to stop dictating, when his audible suffering filled
every pause. "Nay, Willie," he answered "only see that the doors are fast. I would fain keep
all the cry as well as all the wool to ourselves; but as for giving over work, that can only
be when I am in woollen."'[166] From this time forward the brightness of joy and sincerity
of inevitable humour, which perfected the imagery of the earlier novels, are wholly absent,
except in the two short intervals of health unaccountably restored, in which he wrote Redgauntlet
and Nigel.

It is strange, but only a part of the general simplicity of Scott's genius, that these revivals
of earlier power were unconscious, and that the time of extreme weakness in which he wrote
St. Ronan's Well, was that in which he first asserted his own restoration.

It is also a deeply interesting characteristic of his noble nature that he never gains anything
by sickness; the whole man breathes or faints as one creature; the ache that stiffens a limb
chills his heart, and every pang of the stomach paralyses the brain. It is not so with inferior
minds, in the workings of which it is often impossible to distinguish native from narcotic
fancy, and throbs of conscience from those of indigestion. Whether in exaltation or languor,
the colours of mind are always morbid, which gleam on the sea for the 'Ancient Mariner,' and
through the casements on 'St. Agnes' Eve;' but Scott is at once blinded and stultified by sickness;
never has a fit of the cramp without spoiling a chapter, and is perhaps the only author of
vivid imagination who never wrote a foolish word but when he was ill.

It remains only to be noticed on this point that any strong natural excitement, affecting the
deeper springs of his heart, would at once restore his intellectual powers in all their fullness,
and that, far towards their sunset: but that the strong will on which he prided himself, though
it could trample upon pain, silence grief, and compel industry, never could warm his imagination,
or clear the judgment in his darker hours.

I believe that this power of the heart over the intellect is common to all great men: but what
the special character of emotion was, that alone could lift Scott above the power of death,
I am about to ask the reader, in a little while, to observe with joyful care.

The first series of romances then, above named, are all that exhibit the emphasis of his unharmed
faculties. The second group, composed in the three years subsequent to illness all but mortal,
bear every one of them more or less the seal of it.

They consist of the Bride of Lammermuir, Ivanhoe, the Monastery, the Abbot, Kenilworth, and
the Pirate.[167] The marks of broken health on all these are essentially twofold--prevailing
melancholy, and fantastic improbability. Three of the tales are agonizingly tragic, the Abbot
scarcely less so in its main event, and Ivanhoe deeply wounded through all its bright panoply;
while even in that most powerful of the series, the impossible archeries and axestrokes, the
incredibly opportune appearances of Locksley, the death of Ulrica, and the resuscitation of
Athelstane, are partly boyish, partly feverish. Caleb in the Bride, Triptolemus and Halcro
in the Pirate, are all laborious, and the first incongruous; half a volume of the Abbot is
spent in extremely dull detail of Roland's relations with his fellow-servants and his mistress,
which have nothing whatever to do with the future story; and the lady of Avenel herself disappears
after the first volume, 'like a snaw wreath when it's thaw, Jeanie.' The public has for itself
pronounced on the Monastery, though as much too harshly as it has foolishly praised the horrors
of Ravenswood and the nonsense of Ivanhoe; because the modern public finds in the torture and
adventure of these, the kind of excitement which it seeks at an opera, while it has no sympathy
whatever with the pastoral happiness of Glendearg, or with the lingering simplicities of superstition
which give historical likelihood to the legend of the White Lady.

But both this despised tale and its sequel have Scott's heart in them. The first was begun
to refresh himself in the intervals of artificial labour on Ivanhoe. 'It was a relief,' he
said, 'to interlay the scenery most familiar to me[168] with the strange world for which I
had to draw so much on imagination.'[169] Through all the closing scenes of the second he is
raised to his own true level by his love for the queen. And within the code of Scott's work
to which I am about to appeal for illustration of his essential powers, I accept the Monastery
and Abbot, and reject from it the remaining four of this group.

The last series contains two quite noble ones, Redgauntlet and Nigel; two of very high value,
Durward and Woodstock; the slovenly and diffuse Peveril, written for the trade; the sickly
Tales of the Crusaders, and the entirely broken and diseased St. Ronan's Well.

One quite distinctive charm in the Waverleys is their modified use of the Scottish dialect;
but it has not generally been observed, either by their imitators, or the authors of different
taste who have written for a later public, that there is a difference between the dialect of
a language, and its corruption.

A dialect is formed in any district where there are persons of intelligence enough to use the
language itself in all its fineness and force, but under the particular conditions of life,
climate, and temper, which introduce words peculiar to the scenery, forms of word and idioms
of sentence peculiar to the race, and pronunciations indicative of their character and disposition.

Thus 'burn' (of a streamlet) is a word possible only in a country where there are brightly
running waters, 'lassie,' a word possible only where girls are as free as the rivulets, and
'auld,' a form of the southern 'old,' adopted by a race of finer musical ear than the English.

On the contrary, mere deteriorations, or coarse, stridulent, and, in the ordinary sense of
the phrase, 'broad' forms of utterance, are not dialects at all, having nothing dialectic in
them, and all phrases developed in states of rude employment, and restricted intercourse, are
injurious to the tone and narrowing to the power of the language they affect. Mere breadth
of accent does not spoil a dialect as long as the speakers are men of varied idea and good
intelligence; but the moment the life is contracted by mining, millwork, or any oppressive
and monotonous labour, the accents and phrases become debased. It is part of the popular folly
of the day to find pleasure in trying to write and spell these abortive, crippled, and more
or less brutal forms of human speech.

Abortive, crippled, or brutal, are however not necessarily 'corrupted' dialects. Corrupt language
is that gathered by ignorance, invented by vice, misused by insensibility, or minced and mouthed
by affectation, especially in the attempt to deal with words of which only half the meaning
is understood, or half the sound heard. Mrs. Gamp's 'aperiently so'--and the 'undermined' with
primal sense of undermine, of--I forget which gossip, in the Mill on the Floss, are master-
and mistress-pieces in this latter kind. Mrs. Malaprop's 'allegories on the banks of the Nile'
are in a somewhat higher order of mistake: Miss Tabitha Bramble's ignorance is vulgarised by
her selfishness, and Winifred Jenkins' by her conceit. The 'wot' of Noah Claypole, and the
other degradations of cockneyism (Sam Weller and his father are in nothing more admirable than
in the power of heart and sense that can purify even these); the 'trewth' of Mr. Chadband,
and 'natur' of Mr. Squeers, are examples of the corruption of words by insensibility: the use
of the word 'bloody' in modern low English is a deeper corruption, not altering the form of
the word, but defiling the thought in it.

Thus much being understood, I shall proceed to examine thoroughly a fragment of Scott's Lowland
Scottish dialect; not choosing it of the most beautiful kind; on the contrary, it shall be
a piece reaching as low down as he ever allows Scotch to go--it is perhaps the only unfair
patriotism in him, that if ever he wants a word or two of really villainous slang, he gives
it in English or Dutch--not Scotch.

I had intended in the close of this paper to analyse and compare the characters of Andrew Fairservice
and Richie Moniplies for examples, the former of innate evil, unaffected by external influences,
and undiseased, but distinct from natural goodness as a nettle is distinct from balm or lavender;
and the latter of innate goodness, contracted and pinched by circumstance, but still undiseased,
as an oak-leaf crisped by frost, not by the worm. This, with much else in my mind, I must put
off; but the careful study of one sentence of Andrew's will give us a good deal to think of.

I take his account of the rescue of Glasgow Cathedral at the time of the Reformation.

     Ah! it's a brave kirk--nane o' yere whigmaleeries and
     curliewurlies and opensteek hems about it--a' solid,
     weel-jointed mason-wark, that will stand as lang as the
     warld, keep hands and gunpowther aff it. It had amaist a
     douncome lang syne at the Reformation, when they pu'd doun
     the kirks of St. Andrews and Perth, and thereawa', to
     cleanse them o' Papery, and idolatry, and image-worship, and
     surplices, and sic-like rags o' the muckle hure that sitteth
     on seven hills, as if ane wasna braid eneugh for her auld
     hinder end. Sae the commons o' Renfrew, and o' the Barony,
     and the Gorbals, and a' about, they behoved to come into
     Glasgow ae fair morning, to try their hand on purging the
     High Kirk o' Popish nicknackets. But the townsmen o'
     Glasgow, they were feared their auld edifice might slip the
     girths in gaun through siccan rough physic, sae they rang
     the common bell, and assembled the train-bands wi' took o'
     drum. By good luck, the worthy James Rabat was Dean o' Guild
     that year--(and a gude mason he was himsell, made him the
     keener to keep up the auld bigging), and the trades
     assembled, and offered downright battle to the commons,
     rather than their kirk should coup the crans, as others had
     done elsewhere. It wasna for luve o' Paperie--na, na!--nane
     could ever say that o' the trades o' Glasgow--Sae they sune
     came to an agreement to take a' the idolatrous statues of
     sants (sorrow be on them!) out o' their neuks--And sae the
     bits o' stane idols were broken in pieces by Scripture
     warrant, and flung into the Molendinar burn, and the auld
     kirk stood as crouse as a cat when the flaes are kaimed aff
     her, and a'body was alike pleased. And I hae heard wise folk
     say, that if the same had been done in ilka kirk in
     Scotland, the Reform wad just hae been as pure as it is e'en
     now, and we wad hae mair Christian-like kirks; for I hae
     been sae lang in England, that naething will drived out o'
     my head, that the dog-kennel at Osbaldistone-Hall is better
     than mony a house o' God in Scotland.

Now this sentence is in the first place a piece of Scottish history of quite inestimable and
concentrated value. Andrew's temperament is the type of a vast class of Scottish--shall we
call it 'sow-thistlian'--mind, which necessarily takes the view of either Pope or saint that
the thistle in Lebanon took of the cedar or lilies in Lebanon; and the entire force of the
passions which, in the Scottish revolution, foretold and forearmed the French one, is told
in this one paragraph; the coarseness of it, observe, being admitted, not for the sake of the
laugh, any more than an onion in broth merely for its flavour, but for the meat of it; the
inherent constancy of that coarseness being a fact in this order of mind, and an essential
part of the history to be told.

Secondly, observe that this speech, in the religious passion of it, such as there may be, is
entirely sincere. Andrew is a thief, a liar, a coward, and, in the Fair service from which
he takes his name, a hypocrite; but in the form of prejudice, which is all that his mind is
capable of in the place of religion, he is entirely sincere. He does not in the least pretend
detestation of image worship to please his master, or any one else; he honestly scorns the
'carnal morality[171] as dowd and fusionless as rue-leaves at Yule' of the sermon in the upper
cathedral; and when wrapt in critical attention to the 'real savour o' doctrine' in the crypt,
so completely forgets the hypocrisy of his fair service as to return his master's attempt to
disturb him with hard punches of the elbow.

Thirdly. He is a man of no mean sagacity, quite up to the average standard of Scottish common
sense, not a low one; and, though incapable of understanding any manner of lofty thought or
passion, is a shrewd measurer of weaknesses, and not without a spark or two of kindly feeling.
See first his sketch of his master's character to Mr. Hammorgaw, beginning: 'He's no a'thegither
sae void o' sense, neither;' and then the close of the dialogue: 'But the lad's no a bad lad
after a', and he needs some carefu' body to look after him.'

Fourthly. He is a good workman; knows his own business well, and can judge of other craft,
if sound, or otherwise.

All these four qualities of him must be known before we can understand this single speech.
Keeping them in mind, I take it up, word by word.

You observe, in the outset, Scott makes no attempt whatever to indicate accents or modes of
pronunciation by changed spelling, unless the word becomes a quite definitely new and scarcely
writeable one. The Scottish way of pronouncing 'James,' for instance, is entirely peculiar,
and extremely pleasant to the ear. But it is so, just because it does not change the word into
Jeems, nor into Jims, nor into Jawms. A modern writer of dialects would think it amusing to
use one or other of these ugly spellings. But Scott writes the name in pure English, knowing
that a Scots reader will speak it rightly, and an English one be wise in letting it alone.
On the other hand he writes 'weel' for 'well,' because that word is complete in its change,
and may be very closely expressed by the double e. The ambiguous 'u's in 'gude' and 'sune'
are admitted, because far liker the sound than the double o would be, and that in 'hure,' for
grace' sake, to soften the word;--so also 'flaes' for 'fleas.' 'Mony' for 'many' is again positively
right in sound, and 'neuk' differs from our 'nook' in sense, and is not the same word at all,
as we shall presently see.

Secondly, observe, not a word is corrupted in any indecent haste, slowness, slovenliness, or
incapacity of pronunciation. There is no lisping, drawling, slobbering, or snuffling: the speech
is as clear as a bell and as keen as an arrow: and its elisions and contractions are either
melodious, ('na,' for 'not,'--'pu'd,' for 'pulled,') or as normal as in a Latin verse. The
long words are delivered without the slightest bungling; and 'bigging' finished to its last g.

I take the important words now in their places.

Brave. The old English sense of the word in 'to go brave' retained, expressing Andrew's sincere
and respectful admiration. Had he meant to insinuate a hint of the church's being too fine,
he would have said 'braw.'

Kirk. This is of course just as pure and unprovincial a word as 'Kirche,' or 'église.'

Whigmaleerie. I cannot get at the root of this word, but it is one showing that the speaker
is not bound by classic rules, but will use any syllables that enrich his meaning. 'Nipperty-tipperty'
(of his master's 'poetry-nonsense') is another word of the same class. 'Curlieurlie' is of
course just as pure as Shakespeare's 'Hurly-burly.' But see first suggestion of the idea to
Scott at Blair-Adam (L. vi. 264).

Opensteek hems. More description, or better, of the later Gothic cannot be put into four syllables.
'Steek,' melodious for stitch, has a combined sense of closing or fastening. And note that
the later Gothic, being precisely what Scott knew best (in Melrose) and liked best, it is,
here as elsewhere, quite as much himself[172] as Frank, that he is laughing at, when he laughs
with Andrew, whose 'opensteek hems' are only a ruder metaphor for his own 'willow-wreaths changed
to stone.'

Gunpowther. '-Ther' is a lingering vestige of the French '-dre.'

Syne. One of the melodious and mysterious Scottish words which have partly the sound of wind
and stream in them, and partly the range of softened idea which is like a distance of blue
hills over border land ('far in the distant Cheviot's blue'). Perhaps even the least sympathetic
'Englisher' might recognise this, if he heard 'Old Long Since' vocally substituted for the
Scottish words to the air. I do not know the root; but the word's proper meaning is not 'since,'
but before or after an interval of some duration, 'as weel sune as syne.' 'But first on Sawnie
gies a ca', Syne, bauldly in she enters.'

Behoved (to come). A rich word, with peculiar idiom, always used more or less ironically of
anything done under a partly mistaken and partly pretended notion of duty.

Siccan. Far prettier, and fuller in meaning than 'such.' It contains an added sense of wonder;
and means properly 'so great' or 'so unusual.'

Took (o' drum). Classical 'tuck' from Italian 'toccata,' the preluding 'touch' or flourish,
on any instrument (but see Johnson under word 'tucket,' quoting Othello). The deeper Scottish
vowels are used here to mark the deeper sound of the bass drum, as in more solemn warning.

Bigging. The only word in all the sentence of which the Scottish form is less melodious than
the English, 'and what for no,' seeing that Scottish architecture is mostly little beyond Bessie
Bell's and Mary Gray's? 'They biggit a bow're by yon burnside, and theekit it ow're wi rashes.'
But it is pure Anglo-Saxon in roots; see glossary to Fairbairn's edition of the Douglas Virgil,
1710.

Coup. Another of the much-embracing words; short for 'upset,' but with a sense of awkwardness
as the inherent cause of fall; compare Richie Moniplies (also for sense of 'behoved'): 'Ae
auld hirplin deevil of a potter behoved just to step in my way, and offer me a pig (earthern
pot--etym. dub.), as he said "just to put my Scotch ointment in;" and I gave him a push, as
but natural, and the tottering deevil coupit owre amang his own pigs, and damaged a score of
them.' So also Dandie Dinmont in the postchaise: ''Od! I hope they'll no coup us.'

The Crans. Idiomatic; root unknown to me, but it means in this use, full, total, and without
recovery.

Molendinar. From 'molendinum,' the grinding-place. I do not know if actually the local name,[173]
or Scott's invention. Compare Sir Piercie's 'Molinaras.' But at all events used here with bye-sense
of degradation of the formerly idle saints to grind at the mill.

Crouse. Courageous, softened with a sense of comfort.

Ilka. Again a word with azure distance, including the whole sense of 'each' and 'every.' The
reader must carefully and reverently distinguish these comprehensive words, which gather two
or more perfectly understood meanings into one chord of meaning, and are harmonies more than
words, from the above-noted blunders between two half-hit meanings, struck as a bad piano-player
strikes the edge of another note. In English we have fewer of these combined thoughts; so that
Shakespeare rather plays with the distinct lights of his words, than melts them into one. So
again Bishop Douglas spells, and doubtless spoke, the word 'rose,' differently, according to
his purpose; if as the chief or governing ruler of flowers, 'rois,' but if only in her own
beauty, rose.

Christian-like. The sense of the decency and order proper to Christianity is stronger in Scotland
than in any other country, and the word 'Christian' more distinctly opposed to 'beast.' Hence
the back-handed cut at the English for their over-pious care of dogs.

I am a little surprised myself at the length to which this examination of one small piece of
Sir Walter's first-rate work has carried us, but here I must end for this time, trusting, if
the Editor of the Nineteenth Century permit me, yet to trespass, perhaps more than once, on
his readers' patience; but, at all events, to examine in a following paper the technical characteristics
of Scott's own style, both in prose and verse, together with Byron's, as opposed to our fashionably
recent dialects and rhythms; the essential virtues of language, in both the masters of the
old school, hinging ultimately, little as it might be thought, on certain unalterable views
of theirs concerning the code called 'of the Ten Commandments,' wholly at variance with the
dogmas of automatic morality which, summed again by the witches' line, 'Fair is foul, and foul
is fair,' hover through the fog and filthy air of our prosperous England.

    JOHN RUSKIN.

       *       *       *       *       *

'He hated greetings in the market-place, and there were generally loiterers in the streets
to persecute him either about the events of the day, or about some petty pieces of business.'

These lines, which the reader will find near the beginning of the sixteenth chapter of the
first volume of the Antiquary, contain two indications of the old man's character, which, receiving
the ideal of him as a portrait of Scott himself, are of extreme interest to me. They mean essentially
that neither Monkbarns nor Scott had any mind to be called of men, Rabbi, in mere hearing of
the mob; and especially that they hated to be drawn back out of their far-away thoughts, or
forward out of their long-ago thoughts, by any manner of 'daily' news, whether printed or gabbled.
Of which two vital characteristics, deeper in both the men, (for I must always speak of Scott's
creations as if they were as real as himself,) than any of their superficial vanities, or passing
enthusiasms, I have to speak more at another time. I quote the passage just now, because there
was one piece of the daily news of the year 1815 which did extremely interest Scott, and materially
direct the labour of the latter part of his life; nor is there any piece of history in this
whole nineteenth century quite so pregnant with various instruction as the study of the reasons
which influenced Scott and Byron in their opposite views of the glories of the battle of Waterloo.

But I quote it for another reason also. The principal greeting which Mr. Oldbuck on this occasion
receives in the market-place, being compared with the speech of Andrew Fairservice, examined
in my first paper, will furnish me with the text of what I have mainly to say in the present one.

'"Mr. Oldbuck," said the town-clerk (a more important person, who came in front and ventured
to stop the old gentleman), "the provost, understanding you were in town, begs on no account
that you'll quit it without seeing him; he wants to speak to ye about bringing the water frae
the Fairwell spring through a part o' your lands."

'"What the deuce!--have they nobody's land but mine to cut and carve on?--I won't consent,
tell them."

'"And the provost," said the clerk, going on, without noticing the rebuff, "and the council,
wad be agreeable that you should hae the auld stanes at Donagild's Chapel, that ye was wussing
to hae."

'"Eh?--what?--Oho! that's another story--Well, well, I'll call upon the provost, and we'll
talk about it."

'"But ye maun speak your mind on't forthwith, Monkbarns, if ye want the stanes; for Deacon
Harlewalls thinks the carved through-stanes might be put with advantage on the front of the
new council-house--that is, the twa cross-legged figures that the callants used to ca' Robbin
and Bobbin, ane on ilka door-cheek; and the other stane, that they ca'd Ailie Dailie, abune
the door. It will be very tastefu', the Deacon says, and just in the style of modern Gothic."

'"Good Lord deliver me from this Gothic generation!" exclaimed the Antiquary,--"a monument
of a knight-templar on each side of a Grecian porch, and a Madonna on the top of it!--O crimini!--Well,
tell the provost I wish to have the stones, and we'll not differ about the water-course.--It's
lucky I happened to come this way to-day."

'They parted mutually satisfied; but the wily clerk had most reason to exult in the dexterity
he had displayed, since the whole proposal of an exchange between the monuments (which the
council had determined to remove as a nuisance, because they encroached three feet upon the
public road) and the privilege of conveying the water to the burgh, through the estate of Monkbarns,
was an idea which had originated with himself upon the pressure of the moment.'

In this single page of Scott, will the reader please note the kind of prophetic instinct with
which the great men of every age mark and forecast its destinies? The water from the Fairwell
is the future Thirlmere carried to Manchester; the 'auld stanes'[174] at Donagild's Chapel,
removed as a nuisance, foretell the necessary view taken by modern cockneyism, Liberalism,
and progress, of all things that remind them of the noble dead, of their father's fame, or
of their own duty; and the public road becomes their idol, instead of the saint's shrine. Finally,
the roguery of the entire transaction--the mean man seeing the weakness of the honourable,
and 'besting' him--in modern slang, in the manner and at the pace of modern trade--'on the
pressure of the moment.'

But neither are these things what I have at present quoted the passage for.

I quote it, that we may consider how much wonderful and various history is gathered in the
fact, recorded for us in this piece of entirely fair fiction, that in the Scottish borough
of Fairport, (Montrose, really,) in the year 17-- of Christ, the knowledge given by the pastors
and teachers provided for its children by enlightened Scottish Protestantism, of their fathers'
history, and the origin of their religion, had resulted in this substance and sum;--that the
statues of two crusading knights had become, to their children, Robin and Bobbin; and the statue
of the Madonna, Ailie Dailie.

A marvellous piece of history, truly: and far too comprehensive for general comment here. Only
one small piece of it I must carry forward the readers' thoughts upon.

The pastors and teachers aforesaid, (represented typically in another part of this errorless
book by Mr. Blattergowl) are not, whatever else they may have to answer for, answerable for
these names. The names are of the children's own choosing and bestowing, but not of the children's
own inventing. 'Robin' is a classically endearing cognomen, recording the errant heroism of
old days--the name of the Bruce and of Rob Roy. 'Bobbin' is a poetical and symmetrical fulfilment
and adornment of the original phrase. 'Ailie' is the last echo of 'Ave,' changed into the softest
Scottish Christian name familiar to the children, itself the beautiful feminine form of royal
'Louis;' the 'Dailie' again symmetrically added for kinder and more musical endearment. The
last vestiges, you see, of honour for the heroism and religion of their ancestors, lingering
on the lips of babes and sucklings.

But what is the meaning of this necessity the children find themselves under of completing
the nomenclature rhythmically and rhymingly? Note first the difference carefully, and the attainment
of both qualities by the couplets in question. Rhythm is the syllabic and quantitative measure
of the words, in which Robin, both in weight and time, balances Bobbin; and Dailie holds level
scale with Ailie. But rhyme is the added correspondence of sound; unknown and undesired, so
far as we can learn, by the Greek Orpheus, but absolutely essential to, and, as special virtue,
becoming titular of, the Scottish Thomas.

The 'Ryme,'[175] you may at first fancy, is the especially childish part of the work. Not so.
It is the especially chivalric and Christian part of it. It characterises the Christian chant
or canticle, as a higher thing than a Greek ode, melos, or hymnos, or than a Latin carmen.

Think of it, for this again is wonderful! That these children of Montrose should have an element
of music in their souls which Homer had not,--which a melos of David the Prophet and King had
not,--which Orpheus and Amphion had not,--which Apollo's unrymed oracles became mute at the
sound of.

A strange new equity this,--melodious justice and judgment as it were,--in all words spoken
solemnly and ritualistically by Christian human creatures;--Robin and Bobbin--by the Crusader's
tomb, up to 'Dies iræ, dies illa,' at judgment of the crusading soul.

You have to understand this most deeply of all Christian minstrels, from first to last; that
they are more musical, because more joyful, than any others on earth: ethereal minstrels, pilgrims
of the sky, true to the kindred points of heaven and home; their joy essentially the sky-lark's,
in light, in purity; but, with their human eyes, looking for the glorious appearing of something
in the sky, which the bird cannot.

This it is that changes Etruscan murmur into Terza rima--Horatian Latin into Provençal troubadour's
melody; not, because less artful, less wise.

Here is a little bit, for instance, of French ryming just before Chaucer's time--near enough
to our own French to be intelligible to us yet.

    'O quant très-glorieuse vie,
    Quant cil quit out peut et maistrie,
    Veult esprouver pour nécessaire,
    Ne pour quant il ne blasma mie
    La vie de Marthe sa mie:
    Mais il lui donna exemplaire
    D'autrement vivre, et de bien plaire
    A Dieu; et plut de bien à faire:
    Pour se conclut-il que Marie
    Qui estoit à ses piedz sans braire,
    Et pensait d'entendre et de taire,
    Estleut la plus saine partie.

    La meilleur partie esleut-elle
    Et la plus saine et la plus belle,
    Qui jà ne luy sera ostée
    Car par vérité se fut celle
    Qui fut tousjours fresche et nouvelle,
    D'aymer Dieu et d'en estre aymée;
    Car jusqu'au cueur fut entamée,
    Et si ardamment enflammée.
    Que tous-jours ardoit l'estincelle;
    Par quoi elle fut visitée
    Et de Dieu premier comfortée;
    Car charité est trop ysnelle.'

The only law of metre, observed in this song, is that each line shall be octosyllabic:

    Qui fut | tousjours | fresche et | nouvelle,
    D'autre | ment vi | vret de | bien (ben) plaire,
    Et pen  | soit den | tendret | de taire

But the reader must note that words which were two-syllabled in Latin mostly remain yet so
in the French.

    La vi | -e de | Marthe | sa mie,

although mie, which is pet language, loving abbreviation of amica through amie, remains monosyllabic.
But vie elides its e before a vowel:

    Car Mar- | the me | nait vie | active
    Et Ma- | ri-e | contemp | lative;

and custom endures many exceptions. Thus Marie may be three-syllabled as above, or answer to
mie as a dissyllable; but vierge is always, I think, dissyllabic, vier-ge, with even stronger
accent on the -ge, for the Latin -go.

Then, secondly, of quantity, there is scarcely any fixed law. The metres may be timed as the
minstrel chooses--fast or slow--and the iambic current checked in reverted eddy, as the words
chance to come.

But, thirdly, there is to be rich ryming and chiming, no matter how simply got, so only that
the words jingle and tingle together with due art of interlacing and answering in different
parts of the stanza, correspondent to the involutions of tracery and illumination. The whole
twelve-line stanza is thus constructed with two rymes only, six of each, thus arranged:

    AAB | AAB | BBA | BBA |

dividing the verse thus into four measures, reversed in ascent and descent, or descant more
properly; and doubtless with correspondent phases in the voice-given, and duly accompanying,
or following, music; Thomas the Rymer's own precept, that 'tong is chefe in mynstrelsye,' being
always kept faithfully in mind.[176]

Here then you have a sufficient example of the pure chant of the Christian ages; which is always
at heart joyful, and divides itself into the four great forms, Song of Praise, Song of Prayer,
Song of Love, and Song of Battle; praise, however, being the keynote of passion through all
the four forms; according to the first law which I have already given in the laws of Fesolé;
'all great Art is Praise,' of which the contrary is also true, all foul or miscreant Art is
accusation, [Greek: diabolê]: 'She gave me of the tree and I did eat' being an entirely museless
expression on Adam's part, the briefly essential contrary of Love-song.

With these four perfect forms of Christian chant, of which we may take for pure examples the
'Te Deum,' the 'Te Lucis Ante,' the 'Amor che nella mente,'[177] and the 'Chant de Roland,'
are mingled songs of mourning, of Pagan origin (whether Greek or Danish), holding grasp still
of the races that have once learned them, in times of suffering and sorrow; and songs of Christian
humiliation or grief, regarding chiefly the sufferings of Christ, or the conditions of our
own sin: while through the entire system of these musical complaints are interwoven moralities,
instructions, and related histories, in illustration of both, passing into Epic and Romantic
verse, which gradually, as the forms and learnings of society increase, becomes less joyful,
and more didactic, or satiric, until the last echoes of Christian joy and melody vanish in
the 'Vanity of human wishes.'

And here I must pause for a minute or two to separate the different branches of our inquiry
clearly from one another. For one thing, the reader must please put for the present out of
his head all thought of the progress of 'civilisation'--that is to say, broadly, of the substitution
of wigs for hair, gas for candles, and steam for legs. This is an entirely distinct matter
from the phases of policy and religion. It has nothing to do with the British Constitution,
or the French Revolution, or the unification of Italy. There are, indeed, certain subtle relations
between the state of mind, for instance, in Venice, which makes her prefer a steamer to a gondola,
and that which makes her prefer a gazetteer to a duke; but these relations are not at all to
be dealt with until we solemnly understand that whether men shall be Christians and poets,
or infidels and dunces, does not depend on the way they cut their hair, tie their breeches,
or light their fires. Dr. Johnson might have worn his wig in fulness conforming to his dignity,
without therefore coming to the conclusion that human wishes were vain; nor is Queen Antoinette's
civilised hair-powder, as opposed to Queen Bertha's savagely loose hair, the cause of Antoinette's
laying her head at last in scaffold dust, but Bertha in a pilgrim-haunted tomb.

Again, I have just now used the words 'poet' and 'dunce,' meaning the degree of each quality
possible to average human nature. Men are eternally divided into the two classes of poet (believer,
maker, and praiser) and dunce (or unbeliever, unmaker, and dispraiser). And in process of ages
they have the power of making faithful and formative creatures of themselves, or unfaithful
and deformative. And this distinction between the creatures who, blessing, are blessed, and
evermore benedicti, and the creatures who, cursing, are cursed, and evermore maledicti, is
one going through all humanity; antediluvian in Cain and Abel, diluvian in Ham and Shem. And
the question for the public of any given period is not whether they are a constitutional or
unconstitutional vulgus, but whether they are a benignant or malignant vulgus. So also, whether
it is indeed the gods who have given any gentleman the grace to despise the rabble, depends
wholly on whether it is indeed the rabble, or he, who are the malignant persons.

But yet again. This difference between the persons to whom Heaven, according to Orpheus, has
granted 'the hour of delight,'[178] and those whom it has condemned to the hour of detestableness,
being, as I have just said, of all times and nations,--it is an interior and more delicate
difference which we are examining in the gift of Christian, as distinguished from unchristian,
song. Orpheus, Pindar, and Horace are indeed distinct from the prosaic rabble, as the bird
from the snake; but between Orpheus and Palestrina, Horace and Sidney, there is another division,
and a new power of music and song given to the humanity which has hope of the Resurrection.

This is the root of all life and all rightness in Christian harmony, whether of word or instrument;
and so literally, that in precise manner as this hope disappears, the power of song is taken
away, and taken away utterly. When the Christian falls back out of the bright hope of the Resurrection,
even the Orpheus song is forbidden him. Not to have known the hope is blameless: one may sing,
unknowing, as the swan, or Philomela. But to have known and fall away from it, and to declare
that the human wishes, which are summed in that one--'Thy kingdom come'--are vain! The Fates
ordain there shall be no singing after that denial.

For observe this, and earnestly. The old Orphic song, with its dim hope of yet once more Eurydice,--the
Philomela song--granted after the cruel silence,--the Halcyon song--with its fifteen days of
peace, were all sad, or joyful only in some vague vision of conquest over death. But the Johnsonian
vanity of wishes is on the whole satisfactory to Johnson--accepted with gentlemanly resignation
by Pope--triumphantly and with bray of penny trumpets and blowing of steam-whistles, proclaimed
for the glorious discovery of the civilised ages, by Mrs. Barbauld, Miss Edgeworth, Adam Smith,
and Co. There is no God, but have we not invented gunpowder?--who wants a God, with that in
his pocket?[179] There is no Resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but have we not paper
and pens, and cannot every blockhead print his opinions, and the Day of Judgment become Republican,
with everybody for a judge, and the flat of the universe for the throne? There is no law, but
only gravitation and congelation, and we are stuck together in an everlasting hail, and melted
together in everlasting mud, and great was the day in which our worships were born. And there
is no Gospel, but only, whatever we've got, to get more, and, wherever we are, to go somewhere
else. And are not these discoveries, to be sung of, and drummed of, and fiddled of, and generally
made melodiously indubitable in the eighteenth century song of praise?

The Fates will not have it so. No word of song is possible, in that century, to mortal lips.
Only polished versification, sententious pentameter and hexameter, until, having turned out
its toes long enough without dancing, and pattered with its lips long enough without piping,
suddenly Astræa returns to the earth, and a Day of Judgment of a sort, and there bursts out
a song at last again, a most curtly melodious triplet of Amphisbænic ryme. 'Ça ira.'

Amphisbænic, fanged in each ryme with fire, and obeying Ercildoune's precept, 'Tong is chefe
of mynstrelsye,' to the syllable.--Don Giovanni's hitherto fondly chanted 'Andiam, andiam,'
become suddenly impersonal and prophetic: IT shall go, and you also. A cry--before it is a
song, then song and accompaniment together--perfectly done; and the march 'towards the field
of Mars. The two hundred and fifty thousand--they to the sound of stringed music--preceded
by young girls with tricolor streamers, they have shouldered soldier-wise their shovels and
picks, and with one throat are singing Ça ira.'[180]

Through all the springtime of 1790, 'from Brittany to Burgundy, on most plains of France, under
most city walls, there march and constitutionally wheel to the Ça-iraing mood of fife and drum--our
clear glancing phalanxes;--the song of the two hundred and fifty thousand, virgin led, is in
the long light of July.' Nevertheless, another song is yet needed, for phalanx, and for maid.
For, two springs and summers having gone--amphisbænic,--on the 28th of August 1792, 'Dumouriez
rode from the camp of Maulde, eastwards to Sedan.'[181]

And Longwi has fallen basely, and Brunswick and the Prussian king will beleaguer Verdun, and
Clairfait and the Austrians press deeper in over the northern marches, Cimmerian Europe behind.
And on that same night Dumouriez assembles council of war at his lodgings in Sedan. Prussians
here, Austrians there, triumphant both. With broad highway to Paris and little hindrance--we
scattered, helpless here and there--what to advise? The generals advise retreating, and retreating
till Paris be sacked at the latest day possible. Dumouriez, silent, dismisses them,--keeps
only, with a sign, Thouvenot. Silent, thus, when needful, yet having voice, it appears, of
what musicians call tenor-quality, of a rare kind. Rubini-esque, even, but scarcely producible
to fastidious ears at opera. The seizure of the forest of Argonne follows--the cannonade of
Valmy. The Prussians do not march on Paris this time, the autumnal hours of fate pass on--ça
ira--and on the 6th of November, Dumouriez meets the Austrians also. 'Dumouriez wide-winged,
they wide-winged--at and around Jemappes, its green heights fringed and maned with red fire.
And Dumouriez is swept back on this wing and swept back on that, and is like to be swept back
utterly, when he rushes up in person, speaks a prompt word or two, and then, with clear tenor-pipe,
uplifts the hymn of the Marseillaise, ten thousand tenor or bass pipes joining, or say some
forty thousand in all, for every heart leaps up at the sound; and so, with rhythmic march melody,
they rally, they advance, they rush death-defying, and like the fire whirlwind sweep all manner
of Austrians from the scene of action.' Thus, through the lips of Dumouriez, sings Tyrtæus,
Rouget de Lisle,[182] 'Aux armes--marchons!' Iambic measure with a witness! in what wide strophe
here beginning--in what unthought-of antistrophe returning to that council chamber in Sedan!

While these two great songs were thus being composed, and sung, and danced to in cometary cycle,
by the French nation, here in our less giddy island there rose, amidst hours of business in
Scotland and of idleness in England, three troubadours of quite different temper. Different
also themselves, but not opponent; forming a perfect chord, and adverse all the three of them
alike to the French musicians, in this main point--that while the Ça ira and Marseillaise were
essentially songs of blame and wrath, the British bards wrote, virtually, always songs of praise,
though by no means psalmody in the ancient keys. On the contrary, all the three are alike moved
by a singular antipathy to the priests, and are pointed at with fear and indignation by the
pietists, of their day;--not without latent cause. For they are all of them, with the most
loving service, servants of that world which the Puritan and monk alike despised; and, in the
triple chord of their song, could not but appear to the religious persons around them as respectively
and specifically the praisers--Scott of the world, Burns of the flesh, and Byron of the devil.

To contend with this carnal orchestra, the religious world, having long ago rejected its Catholic
Psalms as antiquated and unscientific, and finding its Puritan melodies sunk into faint jar
and twangle from their native trumpet-tone, had nothing to oppose but the innocent, rather
than religious, verses of the school recognised as that of the English Lakes; very creditable
to them; domestic at once and refined; observing the errors of the world outside of the Lakes
with a pitying and tender indignation, and arriving in lacustrine seclusion at many valuable
principles of philosophy, as pure as the tarns of their mountains, and of corresponding depth.[183]

I have lately seen, and with extreme pleasure, Mr. Matthew Arnold's arrangement of Wordsworth's
poems; and read with sincere interest his high estimate of them. But a great poet's work never
needs arrangement by other hands; and though it is very proper that Silver How should clearly
understand and brightly praise its fraternal Rydal Mount, we must not forget that, over yonder,
are the Andes, all the while.

Wordsworth's rank and scale among poets were determined by himself, in a single exclamation:--

    'What was the great Parnassus' self to thee,
    Mount Skiddaw?'

Answer his question faithfully, and you have the relation between the great masters of the
Muse's teaching, and the pleasant fingerer of his pastoral flute among the reeds of Rydal.

Wordsworth is simply a Westmoreland peasant, with considerably less shrewdness than most border
Englishmen or Scotsmen inherit; and no sense of humour: but gifted (in this singularly) with
vivid sense of natural beauty, and a pretty turn for reflections, not always acute, but, as
far as they reach, medicinal to the fever of the restless and corrupted life around him. Water
to parched lips may be better than Samian wine, but do not let us therefore confuse the qualities
of wine and water. I much doubt there being many inglorious Miltons in our country churchyards;
but I am very sure there are many Wordsworths resting there, who were inferior to the renowned
one only in caring less to hear themselves talk.

With an honest and kindly heart, a stimulating egoism, a wholesome contentment in modest circumstances,
and such sufficient ease, in that accepted state, as permitted the passing of a good deal of
time in wishing that daisies could see the beauty of their own shadows, and other such profitable
mental exercises, Wordsworth has left us a series of studies of the graceful and happy shepherd
life of our lake country, which to me personally, for one, are entirely sweet and precious;
but they are only so as the mirror of an existent reality in many ways more beautiful than
its picture.

But the other day I went for an afternoon's rest into the cottage of one of our country people
of old statesman class; cottage lying nearly midway between two village churches, but more
conveniently for downhill walk towards one than the other. I found, as the good housewife made
tea for me, that nevertheless she went up the hill to church. 'Why do not you go to the nearer
church?' I asked. 'Don't you like the clergyman?' 'Oh no, sir,' she answered, 'it isn't that;
but you know I couldn't leave my mother.' 'Your mother! she is buried at H---- then?' 'Yes,
sir; and you know I couldn't go to church anywhere else.'

That feelings such as these existed among the peasants, not of Cumberland only, but of all
the tender earth that gives forth her fruit for the living, and receives her dead to peace,
might perhaps have been, to our great and endless comfort, discovered before now, if Wordsworth
had been content to tell us what he knew of his own villages and people, not as the leader
of a new and only correct school of poetry, but simply as a country gentleman of sense and
feeling, fond of primroses, kind to the parish children, and reverent of the spade with which
Wilkinson had tilled his lands: and I am by no means sure that his influence on the stronger
minds of his time was anywise hastened or extended by the spirit of tunefulness under whose
guidance he discovered that heaven rhymed to seven, and Foy to boy.

Tuneful nevertheless at heart, and of the heavenly choir, I gladly and frankly acknowledge
him; and our English literature enriched with a new and a singular virtue in the aërial purity
and healthful rightness of his quiet song;--but aërial only,--not ethereal; and lowly in its
privacy of light.

A measured mind, and calm; innocent, unrepentant; helpful to sinless creatures and scatheless,
such of the flock as do not stray. Hopeful at least, if not faithful; content with intimations
of immortality such as may be in skipping of lambs, and laughter of children,--incurious to
see in the hands the print of the Nails.

A gracious and constant mind; as the herbage of its native hills, fragrant and pure;--yet,
to the sweep and the shadow, the stress and distress, of the greater souls of men, as the tufted
thyme to the laurel wilderness of Tempe,--as the gleaming euphrasy to the dark branches of Dodona.

[I am obliged to defer the main body of this paper to next month,--revises penetrating all
too late into my lacustrine seclusion; as chanced also unluckily with the preceding paper,
in which the reader will perhaps kindly correct the consequent misprints, p. 29, l. 20, of

    JOHN RUSKIN.

[BYRON.]

    'Parching summer hath no warrant
      To consume this crystal well;
    Rains, that make each brook a torrent,
      Neither sully it, nor swell.'

So was it, year by year, among the unthought-of hills. Little Duddon and child Rotha ran clear
and glad; and laughed from ledge to pool, and opened from pool to mere, translucent, through
endless days of peace.

But eastward, between her orchard plains, Loire locked her embracing dead in silent sands;
dark with blood rolled Iser; glacial-pale, Beresina-Lethe, by whose shore the weary hearts
forgot their people, and their father's house.

Nor unsullied, Tiber; nor unswoln, Arno and Aufidus; and Euroclydon high on Helle's wave; meantime,
let our happy piety glorify the garden rocks with snowdrop circlet, and breathe the spirit
of Paradise, where life is wise and innocent.

Maps many have we, now-a-days clear in display of earth constituent, air current, and ocean
tide. Shall we ever engrave the map of meaner research, whose shadings shall content themselves
in the task of showing the depth, or drought,--the calm, or trouble, of Human Compassion?

For this is indeed all that is noble in the life of Man, and the source of all that is noble
in the speech of Man. Had it narrowed itself then, in those days, out of all the world, into
this peninsula between Cockermouth and Shap?

Not altogether so; but indeed the Vocal piety seemed conclusively to have retired (or excursed?)
into that mossy hermitage, above Little Langdale. The Unvocal piety, with the uncomplaining
sorrow, of Man, may have had a somewhat wider range, for aught we know: but history disregards
those items; and of firmly proclaimed and sweetly canorous religion, there really seemed at
that juncture none to be reckoned upon, east of Ingleborough, or north of Criffel. Only under
Furness Fells, or by Bolton Priory, it seems we can still write Ecclesiastical Sonnets, stanzas
on the force of Prayer, Odes to Duty, and complimentary addresses to the Deity upon His endurance
for adoration. Far otherwise, over yonder, by Spezzia Bay, and Ravenna Pineta, and in ravines
of Hartz. There, the softest voices speak the wildest words; and Keats discourses of Endymion,
Shelley of Demogorgon, Goethe of Lucifer, and Bürger of the Resurrection of Death unto Death--while
even Puritan Scotland and Episcopal Anglia produce for us only these three minstrels of doubtful
tone, who show but small respect for the 'unco guid,' put but limited faith in gifted Gilfillan,
and translate with unflinching frankness the Morgante Maggiore.[184]

Dismal the aspect of the spiritual world, or at least the sound of it, might well seem to the
eyes and ears of Saints (such as we had) of the period--dismal in angels' eyes also assuredly!
Yet is it possible that the dismalness in angelic sight may be otherwise quartered, as it were,
from the way of mortal heraldry; and that seen, and heard, of angels,--again I say--hesitatingly--is
it possible that the goodness of the Unco Guid, and the gift of Gilfillan, and the word of
Mr. Blattergowl, may severally not have been the goodness of God, the gift of God, nor the
word of God: but that in the much blotted and broken efforts at goodness, and in the careless
gift which they themselves despised,[185] and in the sweet ryme and murmur of their unpurposed
words, the Spirit of the Lord had, indeed, wandering, as in chaos days on lightless waters,
gone forth in the hearts and from the lips of those other three strange prophets, even though
they ate forbidden bread by the altar of the poured-out ashes, and even though the wild beast
of the desert found them, and slew.

This, at least, I know, that it had been well for England, though all her other prophets, of
the Press, the Parliament, the Doctor's chair, and the Bishop's throne, had fallen silent;
so only that she had been able to understand with her heart here and there the simplest line
of these, her despised.

I take one at mere chance:

    'Who thinks of self, when gazing on the sky?'[186]

Well, I don't know; Mr. Wordsworth certainly did, and observed, with truth, that its clouds
took a sober colouring in consequence of his experiences. It is much if, indeed, this sadness
be unselfish, and our eyes have kept loving watch o'er Man's Mortality. I have found it difficult
to make any one now-a-days believe that such sobriety can be; and that Turner saw deeper crimson
than others in the clouds of Goldau. But that any should yet think the clouds brightened by
Man's Immortality instead of dulled by his death,--and, gazing on the sky, look for the day
when every eye must gaze also--for behold, He cometh with the clouds--this it is no more possible
for Christian England to apprehend, however exhorted by her gifted and guid.

'But Byron was not thinking of such things!'--He, the reprobate! how should such as he think
of Christ?

Perhaps not wholly as you or I think of Him. Take, at chance, another line or two, to try:

    'Carnage (so Wordsworth tells you) is God's daughter;[187]
    If he speak truth, she is Christ's sister, and
    Just now, behaved as in the Holy Land.'

Blasphemy, cry you, good reader? Are you sure you understand it? The first line I gave you
was easy Byron--almost shallow Byron--these are of the man in his depth, and you will not fathom
them, like a tarn,--nor in a hurry.

'Just now behaved as in the Holy Land.' How did Carnage behave in the Holy Land then? You have
all been greatly questioning, of late, whether the sun, which you find to be now going out,
ever stood still. Did you in any lagging minute, on those scientific occasions, chance to reflect
what he was bid stand still for? or if not--will you please look--and what, also, going forth
again as a strong man to run his course, he saw, rejoicing?

'Then Joshua passed from Makkedah unto Libnah--and fought against Libnah. I wonder how the
world would like to part with them! hitherto it has always preferred parting first with its
Life--and God has taken it at its word. But Death is not His Begotten Son, for all that; nor
is the death of the innocent in battle carnage His 'instrument for working out a pure intent'
as Mr. Wordsworth puts it; but Man's instrument for working out an impure one, as Byron would
have you to know. Theology perhaps less orthodox, but certainly more reverent;--neither is
the Woolwich Infant a Child of God; neither does the iron-clad 'Thunderer' utter thunders of
God--which facts, if you had had the grace or sense to learn from Byron, instead of accusing
him of blasphemy, it had been better at this day for you, and for many a savage soul also,
by Euxine shore, and in Zulu and Afghan lands.

It was neither, however, for the theology, nor the use, of these lines that I quoted them;
but to note this main point of Byron's own character. He was the first great Englishman who
felt the cruelty of war, and, in its cruelty, the shame. Its guilt had been known to George
Fox--its folly shown practically by Penn. But the compassion of the pious world had still for
the most part been shown only in keeping its stock of Barabbases unhanged if possible: and,
till Byron came, neither Kunersdorf, Eylau, nor Waterloo, had taught the pity and the pride
of men that

    'The drying up a single tear has more
    Of honest fame than shedding seas of gore.'[188]

Such pacific verse would not indeed have been acceptable to the Edinburgh volunteers on Portobello
sands. But Byron can write a battle song too, when it is his cue to fight. If you look at the
introduction to the Isles of Greece, namely the 85th and 86th stanzas of the 3rd canto of Don
Juan,--you will find--what will you not find, if only you understand them! 'He' in the first
line, remember, means the typical modern poet.

    'Thus usually, when he was asked to sing,
      He gave the different nations something national.
    'Twas all the same to him--"God save the King"
      Or "Ça ira" according to the fashion all;
    His muse made increment of anything
      From the high lyric down to the low rational:
    If Pindar sang horse races, what should hinder
    Himself from being as pliable as Pindar?

    'In France, for instance, he would write a chanson;
      In England a six-canto quarto tale;
    In Spain, he'd make a ballad or romance on
      The last war--much the same in Portugal;
    In Germany, the Pegasus he'd prance on
      Would be old Goethe's--(see what says de Staël)
    In Italy he'd ape the 'Trecentisti;'
    In Greece, he'd sing some sort of hymn like this t' ye.

Note first here, as we did in Scott, the concentrating and foretelling power. The 'God Save
the Queen' in England, fallen hollow now, as the 'Ça ira' in France--not a man in France knowing
where either France or 'that' (whatever 'that' may be) is going to; nor the Queen of England
daring, for her life, to ask the tiniest Englishman to do a single thing he doesn't like;--nor
any salvation, either of Queen or Realm, being any more possible to God, unless under the direction
of the Royal Society: then, note the estimate of height and depth in poetry, swept in an instant,
'high lyric to low rational.' Pindar to Pope (knowing Pope's height, too, all the while, no
man better); then, the poetic power of France--resumed in a word--Béranger; then the cut at
Marmion, entirely deserved, as we shall see, yet kindly given, for everything he names in these
two stanzas is the best of its kind; then Romance in Spain on--the last war, (present war not
being to Spanish poetical taste), then, Goethe the real heart of all Germany, and last, the
aping of the Trecentisti which has since consummated itself in Pre-Raphaelitism! that also
being the best thing Italy has done through England, whether in Rossetti's 'blessed damozels'
or Burne Jones's 'days of creation.' Lastly comes the mock at himself--the modern English Greek--(followed
up by the 'degenerate into hands like mine' in the song itself); and then--to amazement, forth
he thunders in his Achilles voice. We have had one line of him in his clearness--five of him
in his depth--sixteen of him in his play. Hear now but these, out of his whole heart:--

    'What,--silent yet? and silent all?
      Ah no, the voices of the dead
    Sound like a distant torrent's fall,
      And answer, "Let one living head,
    But one, arise--we come--we come:"
    --'Tis but the living who are dumb.'

Resurrection, this, you see like Bürger's; but not of death unto death.

'Sound like a distant torrent's fall.' I said the whole heart of Byron was in this passage.
First its compassion, then its indignation, and the third element, not yet examined, that love
of the beauty of this world in which the three--unholy--children, of its Fiery Furnace were
like to each other; but Byron the widest-hearted. Scott and Burns love Scotland more than Nature
itself: for Burns the moon must rise over Cumnock Hills,--for Scott, the Rymer's glen divide
the Eildons; but, for Byron, Loch-na-Gar with Ida, looks o'er Troy, and the soft murmurs of
the Dee and the Bruar change into voices of the dead on distant Marathon.

Yet take the parallel from Scott, by a field of homelier rest:--

    'And silence aids--though the steep hills
    Send to the lake a thousand rills;
    In summer tide, so soft they weep,
    The sound but lulls the ear asleep;
    Your horse's hoof-tread sounds too rude,
    So stilly is the solitude.

    Naught living meets the eye or ear,
    But well I ween the dead are near;
    For though, in feudal strife, a foe
    Hath laid our Lady's Chapel low,
    Yet still beneath the hallowed soil,
    The peasant rests him from his toil,
    And, dying, bids his bones be laid
    Where erst his simple fathers prayed.'

And last take the same note of sorrow--with Burns's finger on the fall of it:

    'Mourn, ilka grove the cushat kens,
    Ye hazly shaws and briery dens,
    Ye burnies, wimplin' down your glens
                        Wi' toddlin' din,
    Or foamin' strang wi' hasty stens
                        Frae lin to lin.'

As you read, one after another, these fragments of chant by the great masters, does not a sense
come upon you of some element in their passion, no less than in their sound, different, specifically,
from that of 'Parching summer hath no warrant'? Is it more profane, think you--or more tender--nay,
perhaps, in the core of it, more true?

For instance, when we are told that

              'Wharfe, as he moved along,
    To matins joined a mournful voice,'

is this disposition of the river's mind to pensive psalmody quite logically accounted for by
the previous statement (itself by no means rhythmically dulcet,) that

    'The boy is in the arms of Wharfe,
    And strangled by a merciless force'?

Or, when we are led into the improving reflection,

    'How sweet were leisure, could it yield no more
    Then 'mid this wave-washed churchyard to recline,
    From pastoral graves extracting thoughts divine!'

--is the divinity of the extract assured to us by its being made at leisure, and in a reclining
attitude--as compared with the meditations of otherwise active men, in an erect one? Or are
we perchance, many of us, still erring somewhat in our notions alike of Divinity and Humanity,--poetical
extraction, and moral position?

On the chance of its being so, might I ask hearing for just a few words more of the school
of Belial?

Their occasion, it must be confessed, is a quite unjustifiable one. Some very wicked people--mutineers,
in fact--have retired, misanthropically, into an unfrequented part of the country, and there
find themselves safe, indeed, but extremely thirsty. Whereupon Byron thus gives them to drink:

    'A little stream came tumbling from the height
    And straggling into ocean as it might.
    Its bounding crystal frolicked in the ray
    And gushed from cliff to crag with saltless spray,
    Close on the wild wide ocean,--yet as pure
    And fresh as Innocence; and more secure.
    Its silver torrent glittered o'er the deep
    As the shy chamois' eye o'erlooks the steep,
    While, far below, the vast and sullen swell
    Of ocean's Alpine azure rose and fell.'[189]

Now, I beg, with such authority as an old workman may take concerning his trade, having also
looked at a waterfall or two in my time, and not unfrequently at a wave, to assure the reader
that here is entirely first-rate literary work. Though Lucifer himself had written it, the
thing is itself good, and not only so, but unsurpassably good, the closing line being probably
the best concerning the sea yet written by the race of the sea-kings.

But Lucifer himself could not have written it; neither any servant of Lucifer. I do not doubt
but that most readers were surprised at my saying, in the close of my first paper, that Byron's
'style' depended in any wise on his views respecting the Ten Commandments. That so all-important
a thing as 'style' should depend in the least upon so ridiculous a thing as moral sense: or
that Allegra's father, watching her drive by in Count G.'s coach and six, had any remnant of
so ridiculous a thing to guide,--or check,--his poetical passion, may alike seem more than
questionable to the liberal and chaste philosophy of the existing British public. But, first
of all, putting the question of who writes, or speaks, aside, do you, good reader, know good
'style' when you get it? Can you say, of half-a-dozen given lines taken anywhere out of a novel,
or poem, or play, That is good, essentially, in style, or bad, essentially? and can you say
why such half-dozen lines are good, or bad?

I imagine that in most cases, the reply would be given with hesitation, yet if you will give
me a little patience, and take some accurate pains, I can show you the main tests of style
in the space of a couple of pages.

I take two examples of absolutely perfect, and in manner highest, i. e. kingly, and heroic,
style: the first example in expression of anger, the second of love.

    (1)   'We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us,
          His present, and your pains, we thank you for.
          When we have match'd our rackets to these balls,
          We will in France, by God's grace, play a set,
          Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.'

    (2)   'My gracious Silence, hail!
          Would'st thou have laughed, had I come coffin'd home
          That weep'st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,
          Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
          And mothers that lack sons.'

Let us note, point by point, the conditions of greatness common to both these passages, so
opposite in temper.

A. Absolute command over all passion, however intense; this the first-of-first conditions,
(see the King's own sentence just before, 'We are no tyrant, but a Christian King, Unto whose
grace our passion is as subject As are our wretches fettered in our prisons'); and with this
self-command, the supremely surveying grasp of every thought that is to be uttered, before
its utterance; so that each may come in its exact place, time, and connection. The slightest
hurry, the misplacing of a word, or the unnecessary accent on a syllable, would destroy the
'style' in an instant.

B. Choice of the fewest and simplest words that can be found in the compass of the language,
to express the thing meant: these few words being also arranged in the most straightforward
and intelligible way; allowing inversion only when the subject can be made primary without
obscurity; thus, 'his present, and your pains, we thank you for' is better than 'we thank you
for his present and your pains,' because the Dauphin's gift is by courtesy put before the Ambassador's
pains; but 'when to these balls our rackets we have matched' would have spoiled the style in
a moment, because--I was going to have said, ball and racket are of equal rank, and therefore
only the natural order proper; but also here the natural order is the desired one, the English
racket to have precedence of the French ball. In the fourth line the 'in France' comes first,
as announcing the most important resolution of action; the 'by God's grace' next, as the only
condition rendering resolution possible; the detail of issue follows with the strictest limit
in the final word. The King does not say 'danger,' far less 'dishonour,' but 'hazard' only;
of that he is, humanly speaking, sure.

C. Perfectly emphatic and clear utterance of the chosen words; slowly in the degree of their
importance, with omission however of every word not absolutely required; and natural use of
the familiar contractions of final dissyllable. Thus, 'play a set shall strike' is better than
'play a set that shall strike,' and 'match'd' is kingly short--no necessity could have excused
'matched' instead. On the contrary, the three first words, 'We are glad,' would have been spoken
by the king more slowly and fully than any other syllables in the whole passage, first pronouncing
the kingly 'we' at its proudest, and then the 'are' as a continuous state, and then the 'glad,'
as the exact contrary of what the ambassadors expected him to be.[190]

D. Absolute spontaneity in doing all this, easily and necessarily as the heart beats. The king
cannot speak otherwise than he does--nor the hero. The words not merely come to them, but are
compelled to them. Even lisping numbers 'come,' but mighty numbers are ordained, and inspired.

E. Melody in the words, changeable with their passion fitted to it exactly and the utmost of
which the language is capable--the melody in prose being Eolian and variable--in verse, nobler
by submitting itself to stricter law. I will enlarge upon this point presently.

F. Utmost spiritual contents in the words; so that each carries not only its instant meaning,
but a cloudy companionship of higher or darker meaning according to the passion--nearly always
indicated by metaphor: 'play a set'--sometimes by abstraction--(thus in the second passage
'silence' for silent one) sometimes by description instead of direct epithet ('coffined' for
dead) but always indicative of there being more in the speaker's mind than he has said, or
than he can say, full though his saying be. On the quantity of this attendant fulness depends
the majesty of style; that is to say, virtually, on the quantity of contained thought in briefest
words, such thought being primarily loving and true: and this the sum of all--that nothing
can be well said, but with truth, nor beautifully, but by love.

These are the essential conditions of noble speech in prose and verse alike, but the adoption
of the form of verse, and especially rymed verse, means the addition to all these qualities
of one more; of music, that is to say, not Eolian merely, but Apolline; a construction or architecture
of words fitted and befitting, under external laws of time and harmony.

When Byron says 'rhyme is of the rude,'[191] he means that Burns needs it,--while Henry the
Fifth does not, nor Plato, nor Isaiah--yet in this need of it by the simple, it becomes all
the more religious: and thus the loveliest pieces of Christian language are all in ryme--the
best of Dante, Chaucer, Douglas, Shakespeare, Spenser, and Sidney.

I am not now able to keep abreast with the tide of modern scholarship; (nor, to say the truth,
do I make the effort, the first edge of its waves being mostly muddy, and apt to make a shallow
sweep of the shore refuse:) so that I have no better book of reference by me than the confused
essay on the antiquity of ryme at the end of Turner's Anglo-Saxons. I cannot however conceive
a more interesting piece of work, if not yet done, than the collection of sifted earliest fragments
known of rymed song in European languages. Of Eastern I know nothing; but, this side Hellespont,
the substance of the matter is all given in King Canute's impromptu

    'Gaily (or is it sweetly?--I forget which, and it's no matter)
        sang the monks of Ely,
    As Knut the king came sailing by;'

much to be noted by any who make their religion lugubrious, and their Sunday the eclipse of
the week. And observe further, that if Milton does not ryme, it is because his faculty of Song
was concerning Loss, chiefly; and he has little more than faculty of Croak, concerning Gain;
while Dante, though modern readers never go further with him than into the Pit, is stayed only
by Casella in the ascent to the Rose of Heaven. So, Gibbon can write in his manner the Fall
of Rome; but Virgil, in his manner, the rise of it; and finally Douglas, in his manner, bursts
into such rymed passion of praise both of Rome and Virgil, as befits a Christian Bishop, and
a good subject of the Holy See.

    'Master of Masters--sweet source, and springing well,
    Wide where over all ringes thy heavenly bell;

      *    *    *    *

    Why should I then with dull forehead and vain,
    With rude ingene, and barane, emptive brain,
    With bad harsh speech, and lewit barbare tongue
    Presume to write, where thy sweet bell is rung,
    Or counterfeit thy precious wordis dear?
    Na, na--not so; but kneel when I them hear.
    But farther more--and lower to descend
    Forgive me, Virgil, if I thee offend
    Pardon thy scolar, suffer him to ryme
    Since thou wast but ane mortal man sometime.'

'Before honour is humility.' Does not clearer light come for you on that law after reading
these nobly pious words? And note you whose humility? How is it that the sound of the bell
comes so instinctively into his chiming verse? This gentle singer is the son of--Archibald
Bell-the-Cat!

And now perhaps you can read with right sympathy the scene in Marmion between his father and
King James.

    'His hand the monarch sudden took--
    Now, by the Bruce's soul,
    Angus, my hasty speech forgive,
    For sure as doth his spirit live
    As he said of the Douglas old
    I well may say of you,--
    That never king did subject hold,
    In speech more free, in war more bold,
    More tender and more true:
    And while the king his hand did strain
    The old man's tears fell down like rain.'

I believe the most infidel of scholastic readers can scarcely but perceive the relation between
the sweetness, simplicity, and melody of expression in these passages, and the gentleness of
the passions they express, while men who are not scholastic, and yet are true scholars, will
recognise further in them that the simplicity of the educated is lovelier than the simplicity
of the rude. Hear next a piece of Spenser's teaching how rudeness itself may become more beautiful
even by its mistakes, if the mistakes are made lovingly.

    'Ye shepherds' daughters that dwell on the green,
          Hye you there apace;
    Let none come there but that virgins been
          To adorn her grace:
    And when you come, whereas she in place,
    See that your rudeness do not you disgrace;
          Bind your fillets fast,
          And gird in your waste,
    For more fineness, with a taudry lace.'

    'Bring hither the pink and purple cullumbine
          With gylliflowers;
    Bring coronatiöns, and sops in wine,
          Worn of paramours;
    Strow me the ground with daffadowndillies
    And cowslips, and kingcups, and loved lilies;
          The pretty paunce
          And the chevisaunce
    Shall match with the fair flowre-delice.'[192]

Two short pieces more only of master song, and we have enough to test all by.

    (2) 'No more, no more, since thou art dead,
        Shall we e'er bring coy brides to bed,
        No more, at yearly festivals,
                    We cowslip balls
        Or chains of columbines shall make,
        For this or that occasion's sake.
        No, no! our maiden pleasures be
        Wrapt in thy winding-sheet with thee.'[193]

    (3) 'Death is now the phoenix rest,
        And the turtle's loyal breast
        To eternity doth rest.
        Truth may seem, but cannot be;
        Beauty brag, but 'tis not she:
        Truth and beauty buried be.'[194]

If now, with the echo of these perfect verses in your mind, you turn to Byron, and glance over,
or recall to memory, enough of him to give means of exact comparison, you will, or should,
recognise these following kinds of mischief in him. First, if any one offends him--as for instance
Mr. Southey, or Lord Elgin--'his manners have not that repose that marks the caste,' &c. This
defect in his Lordship's style, being myself scrupulously and even painfully reserved in the
use of vituperative language, I need not say how deeply I deplore.[195]

Secondly. In the best and most violet-bedded bits of his work there is yet, as compared with
Elizabethan and earlier verse, a strange taint; and indefinable--evening flavour of Covent
Garden, as it were;--not to say, escape of gas in the Strand. That is simply what it proclaims
itself--London air. If he had lived all his life in Green-head Ghyll, things would of course
have been different. But it was his fate to come to town--modern town--like Michael's son;
and modern London (and Venice) are answerable for the state of their drains, not Byron.

Thirdly. His melancholy is without any relief whatsoever; his jest sadder than his earnest;
while, in Elizabethan work, all lament is full of hope, and all pain of balsam.

Of this evil he has himself told you the cause in a single line, prophetic of all things since
and now. 'Where he gazed, a gloom pervaded space.'[196]

So that, for instance, while Mr. Wordsworth, on a visit to town, being an exemplary early riser,
could walk, felicitous, on Westminster Bridge, remarking how the city now did like a garment
wear the beauty of the morning; Byron, rising somewhat later, contemplated only the garment
which the beauty of the morning had by that time received for wear from the city: and again,
while Mr. Wordsworth, in irrepressible religious rapture, calls God to witness that the houses
seem asleep, Byron, lame demon as he was, flying smoke-drifted, unroofs the houses at a glance,
and sees what the mighty cockney heart of them contains in the still lying of it, and will
stir up to purpose in the waking business of it,

    'The sordor of civilisation, mixed
    With all the passions which Man's fall hath fixed.'[197]

Fourthly, with this steadiness of bitter melancholy, there is joined a sense of the material
beauty, both of inanimate nature, the lower animals, and human beings, which in the iridescence,
colour-depth, and morbid (I use the word deliberately) mystery and softness of it,--with other
qualities indescribable by any single words, and only to be analysed by extreme care,--is found,
to the full, only in five men that I know of in modern times; namely Rousseau, Shelley, Byron,
Turner, and myself,--differing totally and throughout the entire group of us, from the delight
in clear-struck beauty of Angelico and the Trecentisti; and separated, much more singularly,
from the cheerful joys of Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Scott, by its unaccountable affection for
'Rokkes blak' and other forms of terror and power, such as those of the ice-oceans, which to
Shakespeare were only Alpine rheum; and the Via Malas and Diabolic Bridges which Dante would
have condemned none but lost souls to climb, or cross;--all this love of impending mountains,
coiled thunder-clouds, and dangerous sea, being joined in us with a sulky, almost ferine, love
of retreat in valleys of Charmettes, gulphs of Spezzia, ravines of Olympus, low lodgings in
Chelsea, and close brushwood at Coniston.

And, lastly, also in the whole group of us, glows volcanic instinct of Astræan justice returning
not to, but up out of, the earth, which will not at all suffer us to rest any more in Pope's
serene 'whatever is, is right;' but holds, on the contrary, profound conviction that about
ninety-nine hundredths of whatever at present is, is wrong: conviction making four of us, according
to our several manners, leaders of revolution for the poor, and declarers of political doctrine
monstrous to the ears of mercenary mankind; and driving the fifth, less sanguine, into mere
painted-melody of lament over the fallacy of Hope and the implacableness of Fate.

In Byron the indignation, the sorrow, and the effort are joined to the death: and they are
the parts of his nature (as of mine also in its feebler terms), which the selfishly comfortable
public have, literally, no conception of whatever; and from which the piously sentimental public,
offering up daily the pure emotion of divine tranquillity, shrink with anathema not unembittered
by alarm.

Concerning which matters I hope to speak further and with more precise illustration in my next
paper; but, seeing that this present one has been hitherto somewhat sombre, and perhaps, to
gentle readers, not a little discomposing, I will conclude it with a piece of light biographic
study, necessary to my plan, and as conveniently admissible in this place as afterwards;--namely,
the account of the manner in which Scott--whom we shall always find, as aforesaid, to be in
salient and palpable elements of character, of the World, worldly, as Burns is of the Flesh,
fleshly, and Byron of the Deuce, damnable,--spent his Sunday.

As usual, from Lockhart's farrago we cannot find out the first thing we want to know,--whether
Scott worked after his week-day custom, on the Sunday morning. But, I gather, not; at all events
his household and his cattle rested (L. iii. 108). I imagine he walked out into his woods,
or read quietly in his study. Immediately after breakfast, whoever was in the house, 'Ladies
and gentlemen, I shall read prayers at eleven, when I expect you all to attend' (vii. 306).
Question of college and other externally unanimous prayers settled for us very briefly: 'if
you have no faith, have at least manners.' He read the Church of England service, lessons and
all, the latter, if interesting, eloquently (ibid.). After the service, one of Jeremy Taylor's
sermons (vi. 188). After the sermon, if the weather was fine, walk with his family, dogs included
and guests, to cold picnic (iii. 109), followed by short extempore biblical novelettes; for
he had his Bible, the Old Testament especially, by heart, it having been his mother's last
gift to him (vi. 174). These lessons to his children in Bible history were always given, whether
there was picnic or not. For the rest of the afternoon he took his pleasure in the woods with
Tom Purdie, who also always appeared at his master's elbow on Sunday after dinner was over,
and drank long life to the laird and his lady and all the good company, in a quaigh of whiskey
or a tumbler of wine, according to his fancy (vi. 195). Whatever might happen on the other
evenings of the week, Scott always dined at home on Sunday; and with old friends: never, unless
inevitably, receiving any person with whom he stood on ceremony (v. 335). He came into the
room rubbing his hands like a boy arriving at home for the holidays, his Peppers and Mustards
gambolling about him, 'and even the stately Maida grinning and wagging his tail with sympathy.'
For the usquebaugh of the less honoured week-days, at the Sunday board he circulated the champagne
briskly during dinner, and considered a pint of claret each man's fair share afterwards (v.
339). In the evening, music being to the Scottish worldly mind indecorous, he read aloud some
favourite author, for the amusement or edification of his little circle. Shakespeare it might
be, or Dryden,--Johnson, or Joanna Baillie,--Crabbe, or Wordsworth. But in those days 'Byron
was pouring out his spirit fresh and full, and if a new piece from his hand had appeared, it
was sure to be read by Scott the Sunday evening afterwards; and that with such delighted emphasis
as showed how completely the elder bard had kept up his enthusiasm for poetry at pitch of youth,
and all his admiration of genius, free, pure, and unstained by the least drop of literary jealousy'
(v. 341).

With such necessary and easily imaginable varieties as chanced in having Dandy Dinmont or Captain
Brown for guests at Abbotsford, or Colonel Mannering, Counsellor Pleydell, and Dr. Robertson
in Castle Street, such was Scott's habitual Sabbath: a day, we perceive, of eating the fat,
(dinner, presumably not cold, being a work of necessity and mercy--thou also, even thou, Saint
Thomas of Trumbull, hast thine!) and drinking the sweet, abundant in the manner of Mr. Southey's
cataract of Lodore,--'Here it comes, sparkling.' A day bestrewn with coronatiöns and sops in
wine; deep in libations to good hope and fond memory; a day of rest to beast, and mirth to
man, (as also to sympathetic beasts that can be merry,) and concluding itself in an Orphic
hour of delight, signifying peace on Tweedside, and goodwill to men, there or far away;--always
excepting the French, and Boney.

'Yes, and see what it all came to in the end.'

Not so, dark-virulent Minos-Mucklewrath; the end came of quite other things: of these, came
such length of days and peace as Scott had in his Fatherland, and such immortality as he has
in all lands.

Nathless, firm, though deeply courteous, rebuke, for his sometimes overmuch light-mindedness,
was administered to him by the more grave and thoughtful Byron. For the Lord Abbot of Newstead
knew his Bible by heart as well as Scott, though it had never been given him by his mother
as her dearest possession. Knew it, and, what was more, had thought of it, and sought in it
what Scott had never cared to think, nor been fain to seek.

And loving Scott well, and always doing him every possible pleasure in the way he sees to be
most agreeable to him--as, for instance, remembering with precision, and writing down the very
next morning, every blessed word that the Prince Regent had been pleased to say of him before
courtly audience,--he yet conceived that such cheap ryming as his own Bride of Abydos, for
instance, which he had written from beginning to end in four days, or even the travelling reflections
of Harold and Juan on men and women, were scarcely steady enough Sunday afternoon's reading
for a patriarch-Merlin like Scott. So he dedicates to him a work of a truly religious tendency,
on which for his own part he has done his best,--the drama of Cain. Of which dedication the
virtual significance to Sir Walter might be translated thus. Dearest and last of Border soothsayers,
thou hast indeed told us of Black Dwarfs, and of White Maidens, also of Grey Friars, and Green
Fairies; also of sacred hollies by the well, and haunted crooks in the glen. But of the bushes
that the black dogs rend in the woods of Phlegethon; and of the crooks in the glen, and the
bickerings of the burnie where ghosts meet the mightiest of us; and of the black misanthrope,
who is by no means yet a dwarfed one, and concerning whom wiser creatures than Hobbie Elliot
may tremblingly ask 'Gude guide us, what's yon?' hast thou yet known, seeing that thou hast
yet told, nothing.

Scott may perhaps have his answer. We shall in good time hear.

FOOTNOTES:

[154] Nell, in the Old Curiosity Shop, was simply killed for the market, as a butcher kills
a lamb (see Forster's Life), and Paul was written under the same conditions of illness which
affected Scott--a part of the ominous palsies, grasping alike author and subject, both in Dombey
and Little Dorrit.

[155] Chourineur' not striking with dagger-point, but ripping with knife-edge. Yet I do him,
and La Louve, injustice in classing them with the two others; they are put together only as
parts in the same phantasm. Compare with La Louve, the strength of wild virtue in the 'Louvécienne'
(Lucienne) of Gaboriau--she, province-born and bred; and opposed to Parisian civilisation in
the character of her sempstress friend. 'De ce Paris, où elle était née, elle savait tout--elle
connaissait tout. Rien ne l'étonnait, nul ne l'intimidait. Sa science des détails matériels
de l'existence était inconcevable. Impossible de la duper!--Eh bien! cette fille si laborieuse
et si économe n'avait même pas la plus vague notion des sentiments qui sont l'honneur de la
femme. Je n'avais pas idée d'une si complète absence de sens moral; d'une si inconsciente dépravation,
d'une impudence si effrontément naïve.'--L'Argent des autres, vol. i. p. 358.

[156] The reader who cares to seek it may easily find medical evidence of the physical effects
of certain states of brain disease in producing especially images of truncated and Hermes-like
deformity, complicated with grossness. Horace, in the Epodes, scoffs at it, but not without
horror. Luca Signorelli and Raphael in their arabesques are deeply struck by it: Durer, defying
and playing with it alternately, is almost beaten down again and again in the distorted faces,
hewing halberts, and suspended satyrs of his arabesques round the polyglot Lord's Prayer; it
takes entire possession of Balzac in the Contes Drolatiques; it struck Scott in the earliest
days of his childish 'visions' intensified by the axe-stroke murder of his grand aunt; L. i.
142, and see close of this note. It chose for him the subject of the Heart of Midlothian, and
produced afterwards all the recurrent ideas of executions, tainting Nigel, almost spoiling
Quentin Durward--utterly the Fair Maid of Perth: and culminating in Bizarro, L. x. 149. It
suggested all the deaths by falling, or sinking, as in delirious sleep--Kennedy, Eveline Neville
(nearly repeated in Clara Mowbray), Amy Robsart, the Master of Ravenswood in the quicksand,
Morris, and Corporal Grace-be-here--compare the dream of Gride, in Nicholas Nickleby, and Dickens's
own last words, on the ground, (so also, in my own inflammation of the brain, two years ago,
I dreamed that I fell through the earth and came out on the other side). In its grotesque and
distorting power, it produced all the figures of the Lay Goblin, Pacolet, Flibbertigibbet,
Cockledemoy, Geoffrey Hudson, Fenella, and Nectabanus; in Dickens it in like manner gives Quilp,
Krook, Smike, Smallweed, Miss Mowcher, and the dwarfs and wax-work of Nell's caravan; and runs
entirely wild in Barnaby Rudge, where, with a corps de drame composed of one idiot, two madmen,
a gentleman fool who is also a villain, a shop-boy fool who is also a blackguard, a hangman,
a shrivelled virago, and a doll in ribands--carrying this company through riot and fire, till
he hangs the hangman, one of the madmen, his mother, and the idiot, runs the gentleman-fool
through in a bloody duel, and burns and crushes the shop-boy fool into shapelessness, he cannot
yet be content without shooting the spare lover's leg off, and marrying him to the doll in
a wooden one; the shapeless shop-boy being finally also married in two wooden ones. It is this
mutilation, observe, which is the very sign manual of the plague; joined, in the artistic forms
of it, with a love of thorniness--(in their mystic root, the truncation of the limbless serpent
and the spines of the dragon's wing. Compare Modern Painters, vol. iv., 'Chapter on the Mountain
Gloom,' s. 19); and in all forms of it, with petrifaction or loss of power by cold in the blood,
whence the last Darwinian process of the witches' charm--'cool it with a baboon's blood, then
the charm is firm and good.' The two frescoes in the colossal handbills which have lately decorated
the streets of London (the baboon with the mirror, and the Maskelyne and Cooke decapitation)
are the final English forms of Raphael's arabesque under this influence; and it is well worth
while to get the number for the week ending April 3, 1880, of Young Folks--'A magazine of instructive
and entertaining literature for boys and girls of all ages,' containing 'A Sequel to Desdichado'
(the modern development of Ivanhoe), in which a quite monumental example of the kind of art
in question will be found as a leading illustration of this characteristic sentence, "See,
good Cerberus," said Sir Rupert, "my hand has been struck off. You must make me a hand of iron,
one with springs in it, so that I can make it grasp a dagger." The text is also, as it professes
to be, instructive; being the ultimate degeneration of what I have above called the 'folly'
of Ivanhoe; for folly begets folly down, and down; and whatever Scott and Turner did wrong
has thousands of imitators--their wisdom none will so much as hear, how much less follow!

In both of the Masters, it is always to be remembered that the evil and good are alike conditions
of literal vision: and therefore also, inseparably connected with the state of the health.
I believe the first elements of all Scott's errors were in the milk of his consumptive nurse,
which all but killed him as an infant, L. i. 19--and was without doubt the cause of the teething
fever that ended in his lameness (L. i. 20). Then came (if the reader cares to know what I
mean by Fors, let him read the page carefully) the fearful accidents to his only sister, and
her death, L. i. 17; then the madness of his nurse, who planned his own murder (21), then the
stories continually told him of the executions at Carlisle (24), his aunt's husband having
seen them; issuing, he himself scarcely knows how, in the unaccountable terror that came upon
him at the sight of statuary, 31--especially Jacob's ladder; then the murder of Mrs. Swinton,
and finally the nearly fatal bursting of the blood vessel at Kelso, with the succeeding nervous
illness, 65-67--solaced, while he was being 'bled and blistered till he had scarcely a pulse
left,' by that history of the Knights of Malta--fondly dwelt on and realised by actual modelling
of their fortress, which returned to his mind for the theme of its last effort in passing away.

which is full of other valuable ones. See the old nurse's 'ici bas les choses vont de travers,

[161] Scott's father was habitually ascetic. 'I have heard his son tell that it was common
with him, if any one observed that the soup was good, to taste it again, and say, "Yes--it
is too good, bairns," and dash a tumbler of cold water into his plate.'--Lockhart's Life (Black,
Edinburgh, 1869), vol. i. p. 312. In other places I refer to this book in the simple form of 'L.'

[162] A young lady sang to me, just before I copied out this page for press, a Miss Somebody's
'great song,' 'Live, and Love, and Die.' Had it been written for nothing better than silkworms,
it should at least have added--Spin.

so long?'--Sydney Smith (of the Pirate) to Jeffrey, December 30, 1821. (Letters, vol. ii. p. 223.)

[168] L. vi. p. 188. Compare the description of Fairy Dean, vii. 192.

[169] All, alas! were now in a great measure so written. Ivanhoe, The Monastery, The Abbot
and Kenilworth were all published between December 1819 and January 1821, Constable & Co. giving
five thousand guineas for the remaining copyright of them, Scott clearing ten thousand before
the bargain was completed; and before the Fortunes of Nigel issued from the press Scott had
exchanged instruments and received his bookseller's bills for no less than four 'works of fiction,'
not one of them otherwise described in the deeds of agreement, to be produced in unbroken succession,
each of them to fill up at least three volumes, but with proper saving clauses as to increase
of copy money in case any of them should run to four; and within two years all this anticipation
had been wiped off by Peveril of the Peak, Quentin Durward, St. Ronan's Well, and Redgauntlet.

[170] Woodstock was finished 26th March 1826. He knew then of his ruin; and wrote in bitterness,
but not in weakness. The closing pages are the most beautiful of the book. But a month afterwards
Lady Scott died; and he never wrote glad word more.

[171] Compare Mr. Spurgeon's not unfrequent orations on the same subject.

[172] There are three definite and intentional portraits of himself, in the novels, each giving
a separate part of himself: Mr. Oldbuck, Frank Osbaldistone, and Alan Fairford.

[173] Andrew knows Latin, and might have coined the word in his conceit; but, writing to a
kind friend in Glasgow, I find the brook was called 'Molyndona' even before the building of
the Sub-dean Mill in 1446. See also account of the locality in Mr. George's admirable volume,
Old Glasgow, pp. 129, 149, &c. The Protestantism of Glasgow, since throwing that powder of
saints into her brook Kidron, has presented it with other pious offerings; and my friend goes
on to say that the brook, once famed for the purity of its waters (much used for bleaching),
'has for nearly a hundred years been a crawling stream of loathsomeness. It is now bricked
over, and a carriage way made on the top of it; underneath the foul mess still passes through
the heart of the city, till it falls into the Clyde close to the harbour.'

[174] The following fragments out of the letters in my own possession, written by Scott to
the builder of Abbotsford, as the outer decorations of the house were in process of completion,
will show how accurately Scott had pictured himself in Monkbarns.

    'Abbotsford: April 21, 1817.

'Dear Sir,--Nothing can be more obliging than your attention to the old stones. You have been
as true as the sundial itself.' [The sundial had just been erected.] 'Of the two I would prefer
the larger one, as it is to be in front of a parapet quite in the old taste. But in case of
accidents it will be safest in your custody till I come to town again on the 12th of May. Your
former favours (which were weighty as acceptable) have come safely out here, and will be disposed
of with great effect.'

    'Abbotsford: July 30.

'I fancy the Tolbooth still keeps its feet, but, as it must soon descend, I hope you will remember
me. I have an important use for the niche above the door; and though many a man has got a niche
in the Tolbooth by building, I believe I am the first that ever got a niche out of it on such

'My dear Sir,--I trouble you with this [sic] few lines to thank you for the very accurate drawings
and measurements of the Tolbooth door, and for your kind promise to attend to my interest and
that of Abbotsford in the matter of the Thistle and Fleur de Lis. Most of our scutcheons are
now mounted, and look very well, as the house is something after the model of an old hall (not
a castle), where such things are well in character.' [Alas--Sir Walter, Sir Walter!] 'I intend
the old lion to predominate over a well which the children have christened the Fountain of
the Lions. His present den, however, continues to be the hall at Castle Street.'

'Dear Sir,--I am greatly obliged to you for securing the stone. I am not sure that I will put
up the gate quite in the old form, but I would like to secure the means of doing so. The ornamental
stones are now put up, and have a very happy effect. If you will have the kindness to let me
know when the Tolbooth door comes down, I will send in my carts for the stones; I have an admirable
situation for it. I suppose the door itself' [he means, the wooden one] 'will be kept for the
new jail; if not, and not otherwise wanted, I would esteem it curious to possess it. Certainly
I hope so many sore hearts will not pass through the celebrated door when in my possession
as heretofore.'

that he could see the gloom. To the Devil's true servants, their Master's presence brings both
cheerfulness and prosperity;--with a delightful sense of their own wisdom and virtue; and of
the 'progress' of things in general:--in smooth sea and fair weather,--and with no need either
of helm touch, or oar toil: as when once one is well within the edge of Maelstrom.

substitution of Bacterian birth for it. Nay, nearly Evangelical theology, in contempt for the

its civilisation.

THE

ELEMENTS OF DRAWING

IN

THREE LETTERS TO BEGINNERS

WITH ILLUSTRATIONS DRAWN BY THE AUTHOR

PREFACE.

It may perhaps be thought, that in prefacing a Manual of Drawing, I ought to expatiate on the
reasons why drawing should be learned; but those reasons appear to me so many and so weighty,
that I cannot quickly state or enforce them. With the reader's permission, as this volume is
too large already, I will waive all discussion respecting the importance of the subject, and
touch only on those points which may appear questionable in the method of its treatment.

In the first place, the book is not calculated for the use of children under the age of twelve
or fourteen. I do not think it advisable to engage a child in any but the most voluntary practice
of art. If it has talent for drawing, it will be continually scrawling on what paper it can
get; and should be allowed to scrawl at its own free will, due praise being given for every
appearance of care, or truth, in its efforts. It should be allowed to amuse itself with cheap
colours almost as soon as it has sense enough to wish for them. If it merely daubs the paper
with shapeless stains, the colour-box may be taken away till it knows better: but as soon as
it begins painting red coats on soldiers, striped flags to ships, etc., it should have colours
at command; and, without restraining its choice of subject in that imaginative and historical
art, of a military tendency, which children delight in, (generally quite as valuable, by the
way, as any historical art delighted in by their elders,) it should be gently led by the parents
to try to draw, in such childish fashion as may be, the things it can see and likes,--birds,
or butterflies, or flowers, or fruit. In later years, the indulgence of using the colour should
only be granted as a reward, after it has shown care and progress in its drawings with pencil.
A limited number of good and amusing prints should always be within a boy's reach: in these
days of cheap illustration he can hardly possess a volume of nursery tales without good woodcuts
in it, and should be encouraged to copy what he likes best of this kind; but should be firmly
restricted to a few prints and to a few books. If a child has many toys, it will get tired
of them and break them; if a boy has many prints he will merely dawdle and scrawl over them;
it is by the limitation of the number of his possessions that his pleasure in them is perfected,
and his attention concentrated. The parents need give themselves no trouble in instructing
him, as far as drawing is concerned, beyond insisting upon economical and neat habits with
his colours and paper, showing him the best way of holding pencil and rule, and, so far as
they take notice of his work, pointing out where a line is too short or too long, or too crooked,
when compared with the copy; accuracy being the first and last thing they look for. If the
child shows talent for inventing or grouping figures, the parents should neither check, nor
praise it. They may laugh with it frankly, or show pleasure in what it has done, just as they
show pleasure in seeing it well, or cheerful; but they must not praise it for being clever,
any more than they would praise it for being stout. They should praise it only for what costs
it self-denial, namely attention and hard work; otherwise they will make it work for vanity's
sake, and always badly. The best books to put into its hands are those illustrated by George
Cruikshank or by Richter. (See Appendix.) At about the age of twelve or fourteen, it is quite
time enough to set youth or girl to serious work; and then this book will, I think, be useful
to them; and I have good hope it may be so, likewise, to persons of more advanced age wishing
to know something of the first principles of art.

Yet observe, that the method of study recommended is not brought forward as absolutely the
best, but only as the best which I can at present devise for an isolated student. It is very
likely that farther experience in teaching may enable me to modify it with advantage in several
important respects; but I am sure the main principles of it are sound, and most of the exercises
as useful as they can be rendered without a master's superintendence. The method differs, however,
so materially from that generally adopted by drawing-masters, that a word or two of explanation
may be needed to justify what might otherwise be thought wilful eccentricity.

The manuals at present published on the subject of drawing are all directed, as far as I know,
to one or other of two objects. Either they propose to give the student a power of dexterous
sketching with pencil or water-colour, so as to emulate (at considerable distance) the slighter
work of our second-rate artists; or they propose to give him such accurate command of mathematical
forms as may afterwards enable him to design rapidly and cheaply for manufactures. When drawing
is taught as an accomplishment, the first is the aim usually proposed; while the second is
the object kept chiefly in view at Marlborough House, and in the branch Government Schools
of Design.

Of the fitness of the modes of study adopted in those schools, to the end specially intended,
judgment is hardly yet possible; only, it seems to me, that we are all too much in the habit
of confusing art as applied to manufacture, with manufacture itself. For instance, the skill
by which an inventive workman designs and moulds a beautiful cup, is skill of true art; but
the skill by which that cup is copied and afterwards multiplied a thousandfold, is skill of
manufacture: and the faculties which enable one workman to design and elaborate his original
piece, are not to be developed by the same system of instruction as those which enable another
to produce a maximum number of approximate copies of it in a given time. Farther: it is surely
inexpedient that any reference to purposes of manufacture should interfere with the education
of the artist himself. Try first to manufacture a Raphael; then let Raphael direct your manufacture.
He will design you a plate, or cup, or a house, or a palace, whenever you want it, and design
them in the most convenient and rational way; but do not let your anxiety to reach the platter
and the cup interfere with your education of the Raphael. Obtain first the best work you can,
and the ablest hands, irrespective of any consideration of economy or facility of production.
Then leave your trained artist to determine how far art can be popularised, or manufacture
ennobled.

Now, I believe that (irrespective of differences in individual temper and character) the excellence
of an artist, as such, depends wholly on refinement of perception, and that it is this, mainly,
which a master or a school can teach; so that while powers of invention distinguish man from
man, powers of perception distinguish school from school. All great schools enforce delicacy
of drawing and subtlety of sight: and the only rule which I have, as yet, found to be without
exception respecting art, is that all great art is delicate.

Therefore, the chief aim and bent of the following system is to obtain, first, a perfectly
patient, and, to the utmost of the pupil's power, a delicate method of work, such as may ensure
his seeing truly. For I am nearly convinced, that when once we see keenly enough, there is
very little difficulty in drawing what we see; but, even supposing that this difficulty be
still great, I believe that the sight is a more important thing than the drawing; and I would
rather teach drawing that my pupils may learn to love Nature, than teach the looking at Nature
that they may learn to draw. It is surely also a more important thing for young people and
unprofessional students, to know how to appreciate the art of others, than to gain much power
in art themselves. Now the modes of sketching ordinarily taught are inconsistent with this
power of judgment. No person trained to the superficial execution of modern water-colour painting,
can understand the work of Titian or Leonardo; they must for ever remain blind to the refinement
of such men's pencilling, and the precision of their thinking. But, however slight a degree
of manipulative power the student may reach by pursuing the mode recommended to him in these
letters, I will answer for it that he cannot go once through the advised exercises without
beginning to understand what masterly work means; and, by the time he has gained some proficiency
in them, he will have a pleasure in looking at the painting of the great schools, and a new
perception of the exquisiteness of natural scenery, such as would repay him for much more labour
than I have asked him to undergo.

That labour is, nevertheless, sufficiently irksome, nor is it possible that it should be otherwise,
so long as the pupil works unassisted by a master. For the smooth and straight road which admits
unembarrassed progress must, I fear, be dull as well as smooth; and the hedges need to be close
and trim when there is no guide to warn or bring back the erring traveller. The system followed
in this work will, therefore, at first, surprise somewhat sorrowfully those who are familiar
with the practice of our class at the Working Men's College; for there, the pupil, having the
master at his side to extricate him from such embarrassments as his first efforts may lead
into, is at once set to draw from a solid object, and soon finds entertainment in his efforts
and interest in his difficulties. Of course the simplest object which it is possible to set
before the eye is a sphere; and practically, I find a child's toy, a white leather ball, better
than anything else; as the gradations on balls of plaster of Paris, which I use sometimes to
try the strength of pupils who have had previous practice, are a little too delicate for a
beginner to perceive. It has been objected that a circle, or the outline of a sphere, is one
of the most difficult of all lines to draw. It is so; but I do not want it to be drawn. All
that his study of the ball is to teach the pupil, is the way in which shade gives the appearance
of projection. This he learns most satisfactorily from a sphere; because any solid form, terminated
by straight lines or flat surfaces, owes some of its appearance of projection to its perspective;
but in the sphere, what, without shade, was a flat circle, becomes, merely by the added shade,
the image of a solid ball; and this fact is just as striking to the learner, whether his circular
outline be true or false. He is, therefore, never allowed to trouble himself about it; if he
makes the ball look as oval as an egg, the degree of error is simply pointed out to him, and
he does better next time, and better still the next. But his mind is always fixed on the gradation
of shade, and the outline left to take, in due time, care of itself. I call it outline, for
the sake of immediate intelligibility,--strictly speaking, it is merely the edge of the shade;
no pupil in my class being ever allowed to draw an outline, in the ordinary sense. It is pointed
out to him, from the first, that Nature relieves one mass, or one tint, against another; but
outlines none. The outline exercise, the second suggested in this letter, is recommended, not
to enable the pupil to draw outlines, but as the only means by which, unassisted, he can test
his accuracy of eye, and discipline his hand. When the master is by, errors in the form and
extent of shadows can be pointed out as easily as in outline, and the handling can be gradually
corrected in details of the work. But the solitary student can only find out his own mistakes
by help of the traced limit, and can only test the firmness of his hand by an exercise in which
nothing but firmness is required; and during which all other considerations (as of softness,
complexity, &c.) are entirely excluded.

Both the system adopted at the Working Men's College, and that recommended here, agree, however,
in one principle, which I consider the most important and special of all that are involved
in my teaching: namely, the attaching its full importance, from the first, to local colour.
I believe that the endeavour to separate, in the course of instruction, the observation of
light and shade from that of local colour, has always been, and must always be, destructive
of the student's power of accurate sight, and that it corrupts his taste as much as it retards
his progress. I will not occupy the reader's time by any discussion of the principle here,
but I wish him to note it as the only distinctive one in my system, so far as it is a system.
For the recommendation to the pupil to copy faithfully, and without alteration, whatever natural
object he chooses to study, is serviceable, among other reasons, just because it gets rid of
systematic rules altogether, and teaches people to draw, as country lads learn to ride, without
saddle or stirrups; my main object being, at first, not to get my pupils to hold their reins
prettily, but to "sit like a jackanapes, never off."

In these written instructions, therefore, it has always been with regret that I have seen myself
forced to advise anything like monotonous or formal discipline. But, to the unassisted student,
such formalities are indispensable, and I am not without hope that the sense of secure advancement,
and the pleasure of independent effort, may render the following out of even the more tedious
exercises here proposed, possible to the solitary learner, without weariness. But if it should
be otherwise, and he finds the first steps painfully irksome, I can only desire him to consider
whether the acquirement of so great a power as that of pictorial expression of thought be not
worth some toil; or whether it is likely, in the natural order of matters in this working world,
that so great a gift should be attainable by those who will give no price for it.

One task, however, of some difficulty, the student will find I have not imposed upon him: namely,
learning the laws of perspective. It would be worth while to learn them, if he could do so
easily; but without a master's help, and in the way perspective is at present explained in
treatises, the difficulty is greater than the gain. For perspective is not of the slightest
use, except in rudimentary work. You can draw the rounding line of a table in perspective,
but you cannot draw the sweep of a sea bay; you can foreshorten a log of wood by it, but you
cannot foreshorten an arm. Its laws are too gross and few to be applied to any subtle form;
therefore, as you must learn to draw the subtle forms by the eye, certainly you may draw the
simple ones. No great painters ever trouble themselves about perspective, and very few of them
know its laws; they draw everything by the eye, and, naturally enough, disdain in the easy
parts of their work rules which cannot help them in difficult ones. It would take about a month's
labour to draw imperfectly, by laws of perspective, what any great Venetian will draw perfectly
in five minutes, when he is throwing a wreath of leaves round a head, or bending the curves
of a pattern in and out among the folds of drapery. It is true that when perspective was first
discovered, everybody amused themselves with it; and all the great painters put fine saloons
and arcades behind their madonnas, merely to show that they could draw in perspective: but
even this was generally done by them only to catch the public eye, and they disdained the perspective
so much, that though they took the greatest pains with the circlet of a crown, or the rim of
a crystal cup, in the heart of their picture, they would twist their capitals of columns and
towers of churches about in the background in the most wanton way, wherever they liked the
lines to go, provided only they left just perspective enough to please the public. In modern
days, I doubt if any artist among us, except David Roberts, knows so much perspective as would
enable him to draw a Gothic arch to scale, at a given angle and distance. Turner, though he
was professor of perspective to the Royal Academy, did not know what he professed, and never,
as far as I remember, drew a single building in true perspective in his life; he drew them
only with as much perspective as suited him. Prout also knew nothing of perspective, and twisted
his buildings, as Turner did, into whatever shapes he liked. I do not justify this; and would
recommend the student at least to treat perspective with common civility, but to pay no court
to it. The best way he can learn it, by himself, is by taking a pane of glass, fixed in a frame,
so that it can be set upright before the eye, at the distance at which the proposed sketch
is intended to be seen. Let the eye be placed at some fixed point, opposite the middle of the
pane of glass, but as high or as low as the student likes; then with a brush at the end of
a stick, and a little body-colour that will adhere to the glass, the lines of the landscape
may be traced on the glass, as you see them through it. When so traced they are all in true
perspective. If the glass be sloped in any direction, the lines are still in true perspective,
only it is perspective calculated for a sloping plane, while common perspective always supposes
the plane of the picture to be vertical. It is good, in early practice, to accustom yourself
to enclose your subject, before sketching it, with a light frame of wood held upright before
you; it will show you what you may legitimately take into your picture, and what choice there
is between a narrow foreground near you, and a wide one farther off; also, what height of tree
or building you can properly take in, &c.[198]

Of figure drawing, nothing is said in the following pages, because I do not think figures,
as chief subjects, can be drawn to any good purpose by an amateur. As accessaries in landscape,
they are just to be drawn on the same principles as anything else.

Lastly: If any of the directions given subsequently to the student should be found obscure
by him, or if at any stage of the recommended practice he finds himself in difficulties which
I have not provided enough against, he may apply by letter to Mr. Ward, who is my under drawing-master
at the Working Men's College (45 Great Ormond Street), and who will give any required assistance,
on the lowest terms that can remunerate him for the occupation of his time. I have not leisure
myself in general to answer letters of inquiry, however much I may desire to do so; but Mr.
Ward has always the power of referring any question to me when he thinks it necessary. I have
good hope, however, that enough guidance is given in this work to prevent the occurrence of
any serious embarrassment; and I believe that the student who obeys its directions will find,
on the whole, that the best answer of questions is perseverance; and the best drawing-masters
are the woods and hills.

FOOTNOTES:

[198] If the student is fond of architecture, and wishes to know more of perspective than he
can learn in this rough way, Mr. Runciman (of 40 Accacia Road, St. John's Wood), who was my
first drawing-master, and to whom I owe many happy hours, can teach it him quickly, easily,
and rightly.

THE

ELEMENTS OF DRAWING.

LETTER I.

ON FIRST PRACTICE.

MY DEAR READER:

Whether this book is to be of use to you or not, depends wholly on your reason for wishing
to learn to draw. If you desire only to possess a graceful accomplishment, to be able to converse
in a fluent manner about drawing, or to amuse yourself listlessly in listless hours, I cannot
help you: but if you wish to learn drawing that you may be able to set down clearly, and usefully,
records of such things as cannot be described in words, either to assist your own memory of
them, or to convey distinct ideas of them to other people; if you wish to obtain quicker perceptions
of the beauty of the natural world, and to preserve something like a true image of beautiful
things that pass away, or which you must yourself leave; if, also, you wish to understand the
minds of great painters, and to be able to appreciate their work sincerely, seeing it for yourself,
and loving it, not merely taking up the thoughts of other people about it; then I can help
you, or, which is better, show you how to help yourself.

Only you must understand, first of all, that these powers which indeed are noble and desirable,
cannot be got without work. It is much easier to learn to draw well, than it is to learn to
play well on any musical instrument; but you know that it takes three or four years of practice,
giving three or four hours a day, to acquire even ordinary command over the keys of a piano;
and you must not think that a masterly command of your pencil, and the knowledge of what may
be done with it, can be acquired without painstaking, or in a very short time. The kind of
drawing which is taught, or supposed to be taught, in our schools, in a term or two, perhaps
at the rate of an hour's practice a week, is not drawing at all. It is only the performance
of a few dexterous (not always even that) evolutions on paper with a black-lead pencil; profitless
alike to performer and beholder, unless as a matter of vanity, and that the smallest possible
vanity. If any young person, after being taught what is, in polite circles, called "drawing,"
will try to copy the commonest piece of real work--suppose a lithograph on the title-page of
a new opera air, or a woodcut in the cheapest illustrated newspaper of the day--they will find
themselves entirely beaten. And yet that common lithograph was drawn with coarse chalk, much
more difficult to manage than the pencil of which an accomplished young lady is supposed to
have command; and that woodcut was drawn in urgent haste, and half spoiled in the cutting afterwards;
and both were done by people whom nobody thinks of as artists, or praises for their power;
both were done for daily bread, with no more artist's pride than any simple handicraftsmen
feel in the work they live by.

Do not, therefore, think that you can learn drawing, any more than a new language, without
some hard and disagreeable labour. But do not, on the other hand, if you are ready and willing
to pay this price, fear that you may be unable to get on for want of special talent. It is
indeed true that the persons who have peculiar talent for art, draw instinctively and get on
almost without teaching; though never without toil. It is true, also, that of inferior talent
for drawing there are many degrees; it will take one person a much longer time than another
to attain the same results, and the results thus painfully attained are never quite so satisfactory
as those got with greater ease when the faculties are naturally adapted to the study. But I
have never yet, in the experiments I have made, met with a person who could not learn to draw
at all; and, in general, there is a satisfactory and available power in every one to learn
drawing if he wishes, just as nearly all persons have the power of learning French, Latin,
or arithmetic, in a decent and useful degree, if their lot in life requires them to possess
such knowledge.

Supposing then that you are ready to take a certain amount of pains, and to bear a little irksomeness
and a few disappointments bravely, I can promise you that an hour's practice a day for six
months, or an hour's practice every other day for twelve months, or, disposed in whatever way
you find convenient, some hundred and fifty hours' practice, will give you sufficient power
of drawing faithfully whatever you want to draw, and a good judgment, up to a certain point,
of other people's work: of which hours, if you have one to spare at present, we may as well
begin at once.

EXERCISE I.

Everything that you can see, in the world around you, presents itself to your eyes only as
an arrangement of patches of different colours variously shaded.[199] Some of these patches
of colour have an appearance of lines or texture within them, as a piece of cloth or silk has
of threads, or an animal's skin shows texture of hairs; but whether this be the case or not,
the first broad aspect of the thing is that of a patch of some definite colour; and the first
thing to be learned is, how to produce extents of smooth colour, without texture.

This can only be done properly with a brush; but a brush, being soft at the point, causes so
much uncertainty in the touch of an unpractised hand, that it is hardly possible to learn to
draw first with it, and it is better to take, in early practice, some instrument with a hard
and fine point, both that we may give some support to the hand, and that by working over the
subject with so delicate a point, the attention may be properly directed to all the most minute
parts of it. Even the best artists need occasionally to study subjects with a pointed instrument,
in order thus to discipline their attention: and a beginner must be content to do so for a
considerable period.

Also, observe that before we trouble ourselves about differences of colour, we must be able
to lay on one colour properly, in whatever gradations of depth and whatever shapes we want.
We will try, therefore, first to lay on tints or patches of grey, of whatever depth we want,
with a pointed instrument. Take any finely-pointed steel pen (one of Gillott's lithographic
crow-quills is best), and a piece of quite smooth, but not shining, note-paper, cream-laid,
and get some ink that has stood already some time in the inkstand, so as to be quite black,
and as thick as it can be without clogging the pen. Take a rule, and draw four straight lines,
so as to enclose a square or nearly a square, about as large as a, Fig. 1. I say nearly a square,
because it does not in the least matter whether it is quite square or not, the object being
merely to get a space enclosed by straight lines.

Now, try to fill in that square space with crossed lines, so completely and evenly that it
shall look like a square patch of grey silk or cloth, cut out and laid on the white paper,
as at b. Cover it quickly, first with straightish lines, in any direction you like, not troubling
yourself to draw them much closer or neater than those in the square a. Let them quite dry
before retouching them. (If you draw three or four squares side by side, you may always be
going on with one while the others are drying). Then cover these lines with others in a different
direction, and let those dry; then in another direction still, and let those dry. Always wait
long enough to run no risk of blotting, and then draw the lines as quickly as you can. Each
ought to be laid on as swiftly as the dash of the pen of a good writer; but if you try to reach
this great speed at first you will go over the edge of the square, which is a fault in this
exercise. Yet it is better to do so now and then than to draw the lines very slowly; for if
you do, the pen leaves a little dot of ink at the end of each line, and these dots spoil your
work. So draw each line quickly, stopping always as nearly as you can at the edge of the square.
The ends of lines which go over the edge are afterwards to be removed with the penknife, but
not till you have done the whole work, otherwise you roughen the paper, and the next line that
goes over the edge makes a blot.

When you have gone over the whole three or four times, you will find some parts of the square
look darker than other parts. Now try to make the lighter parts as dark as the rest, so that
the whole may be of equal depth or darkness. You will find, on examining the work, that where
it looks darkest the lines are closest, or there are some much darker lines, than elsewhere;
therefore you must put in other lines, or little scratches and dots, between the lines in the
paler parts; and where there are very conspicuous dark lines, scratch them out lightly with
the penknife, for the eye must not be attracted by any line in particular. The more carefully
and delicately you fill in the little gaps and holes the better; you will get on faster by
doing two or three squares perfectly than a great many badly. As the tint gets closer and begins
to look even, work with very little ink in your pen, so as hardly to make any mark on the paper;
and at last, where it is too dark, use the edge of your penknife very lightly, and for some
time, to wear it softly into an even tone. You will find that the greatest difficulty consists
in getting evenness: one bit will always look darker than another bit of your square; or there
will be a granulated and sandy look over the whole. When you find your paper quite rough and
in a mess, give it up and begin another square, but do not rest satisfied till you have done
your best with every square. The tint at last ought at least to be as close and even as that
in b, Fig. 1. You will find, however, that it is very difficult to get a pale tint; because,
naturally, the ink lines necessary to produce a close tint at all, blacken the paper more than
you want. You must get over this difficulty not so much by leaving the lines wide apart as
by trying to draw them excessively fine, lightly and swiftly; being very cautious in filling
in; and, at last, passing the penknife over the whole. By keeping several squares in progress
at one time, and reserving your pen for the light one just when the ink is nearly exhausted,
you may get on better. The paper ought, at last, to look lightly and evenly toned all over,
with no lines distinctly visible.

EXERCISE II.

As this exercise in shading is very tiresome, it will be well to vary it by proceeding with
another at the same time. The power of shading rightly depends mainly on lightness of hand
and keenness of sight; but there are other qualities required in drawing, dependent not merely
on lightness, but steadiness of hand; and the eye, to be perfect in its power, must be made
accurate as well as keen, and not only see shrewdly, but measure justly.

Possess yourself, therefore, of any cheap work on botany containing outline plates of leaves
and flowers, it does not matter whether bad or good: "Baxter's British Flowering Plants" is
quite good enough. Copy any of the simplest outlines, first with a soft pencil, following it,
by the eye, as nearly as you can; if it does not look right in proportions, rub out and correct
it, always by the eye, till you think it is right: when you have got it to your mind, lay tracing-paper
on the book, on this paper trace the outline you have been copying, and apply it to your own;
and having thus ascertained the faults, correct them all patiently, till you have got it as
nearly accurate as may be. Work with a very soft pencil, and do not rub out so hard[200] as
to spoil the surface of your paper; never mind how dirty the paper gets, but do not roughen
it; and let the false outlines alone where they do not really interfere with the true one.
It is a good thing to accustom yourself to hew and shape your drawing out of a dirty piece
of paper. When you have got it as right as you can, take a quill pen, not very fine at the
point; rest your hand on a book about an inch and a half thick, so as to hold the pen long;
and go over your pencil outline with ink, raising your pen point as seldom as possible, and
never leaning more heavily on one part of the line than on another. In most outline drawings
of the present day, parts of the curves are thickened to give an effect of shade; all such
outlines are bad, but they will serve well enough for your exercises, provided you do not imitate
this character: it is better, however, if you can, to choose a book of pure outlines. It does
not in the least matter whether your pen outline be thin or thick; but it matters greatly that
it should be equal, not heavier in one place than in another. The power to be obtained is that
of drawing an even line slowly and in any direction; all dashing lines, or approximations to
penmanship, are bad. The pen should, as it were, walk slowly over the ground, and you should
be able at any moment to stop it, or to turn it in any other direction, like a well-managed horse.

As soon as you can copy every curve slowly and accurately, you have made satisfactory progress;
but you will find the difficulty is in the slowness. It is easy to draw what appears to be
a good line with a sweep of the hand, or with what is called freedom;[201] the real difficulty
and masterliness is in never letting the hand be free, but keeping it under entire control
at every part of the line.

EXERCISE III.

Meantime, you are always to be going on with your shaded squares, and chiefly with these, the
outline exercises being taken up only for rest.

As soon as you find you have some command of the pen as a shading instrument, and can lay a
pale or dark tint as you choose, try to produce gradated spaces like Fig. 2., the dark tint
passing gradually into the lighter ones. Nearly all expression of form, in drawing, depends
on your power of gradating delicately; and the gradation is always most skilful which passes
from one tint into another very little paler. Draw, therefore, two parallel lines for limits
to your work, as in Fig. 2., and try to gradate the shade evenly from white to black, passing
over the greatest possible distance, yet so that every part of the band may have visible change
in it. The perception of gradation is very deficient in all beginners (not to say, in many
artists), and you will probably, for some time, think your gradation skilful enough when it
is quite patchy and imperfect. By getting a piece of grey shaded riband, and comparing it with
your drawing, you may arrive, in early stages of your work, at a wholesome dissatisfaction
with it. Widen your band little by little as you get more skilful, so as to give the gradation
more lateral space, and accustom yourself at the same time to look for gradated spaces in Nature.
The sky is the largest and the most beautiful; watch it at twilight, after the sun is down,
and try to consider each pane of glass in the window you look through as a piece of paper coloured
blue, or grey, or purple, as it happens to be, and observe how quietly and continuously the
gradation extends over the space in the window, of one or two feet square. Observe the shades
on the outside and inside of a common white cup or bowl, which make it look round and hollow;[202]
and then on folds of white drapery; and thus gradually you will be led to observe the more
subtle transitions of the light as it increases or declines on flat surfaces. At last, when
your eye gets keen and true, you will see gradation on everything in Nature.

But it will not be in your power yet awhile to draw from any objects in which the gradations
are varied and complicated; nor will it be a bad omen for your future progress, and for the
use that art is to be made of by you, if the first thing at which you aim should be a little
bit of sky. So take any narrow space of evening sky, that you can usually see, between the
boughs of a tree, or between two chimneys, or through the corner of a pane in the window you
like best to sit at, and try to gradate a little space of white paper as evenly as that is
gradated--as tenderly you cannot gradate it without colour, no, nor with colour either; but
you may do it as evenly; or, if you get impatient with your spots and lines of ink, when you
look at the beauty of the sky, the sense you will have gained of that beauty is something to
be thankful for. But you ought not to be impatient with your pen and ink; for all great painters,
however delicate their perception of colour, are fond of the peculiar effect of light which
may be got in a pen-and-ink sketch, and in a woodcut, by the gleaming of the white paper between
the black lines; and if you cannot gradate well with pure black lines, you will never gradate
well with pale ones. By looking at any common woodcuts, in the cheap publications of the day,
you may see how gradation is given to the sky by leaving the lines farther and farther apart;
but you must make your lines as fine as you can, as well as far apart, towards the light; and
do not try to make them long or straight, but let them cross irregularly in any direction easy
to your hand, depending on nothing but their gradation for your effect. On this point of direction
of lines, however, I shall have to tell you more presently; in the meantime, do not trouble
yourself about it.

EXERCISE IV.

As soon as you find you can gradate tolerably with the pen, take an H. or HH. pencil, using
its point to produce shade, from the darkest possible to the palest, in exactly the same manner
as the pen, lightening, however, now with India-rubber instead of the penknife. You will find
that all pale tints of shade are thus easily producible with great precision and tenderness,
but that you cannot get the same dark power as with the pen and ink, and that the surface of
the shade is apt to become glossy and metallic, or dirty-looking, or sandy. Persevere, however,
in trying to bring it to evenness with the fine point, removing any single speck or line that
may be too black, with the point of the knife: you must not scratch the whole with the knife
as you do the ink. If you find the texture very speckled-looking, lighten it all over with
India-rubber, and recover it again with sharp, and excessively fine touches of the pencil point,
bringing the parts that are too pale to perfect evenness with the darker spots.

You cannot use the point too delicately or cunningly in doing this; work with it as if you
were drawing the down on a butterfly's wing.

At this stage of your progress, if not before, you may be assured that some clever friend will
come in, and hold up his hands in mocking amazement, and ask you who could set you to that
"niggling;" and if you persevere in it, you will have to sustain considerable persecution from
your artistical acquaintances generally, who will tell you that all good drawing depends on
"boldness." But never mind them. You do not hear them tell a child, beginning music, to lay
its little hand with a crash among the keys, in imitation of the great masters; yet they might,
as reasonably as they may tell you to be bold in the present state of your knowledge. Bold,
in the sense of being undaunted, yes; but bold in the sense of being careless, confident, or
exhibitory,--no,--no, and a thousand times no; for, even if you were not a beginner, it would
be bad advice that made you bold. Mischief may easily be done quickly, but good and beautiful
work is generally done slowly; you will find no boldness in the way a flower or a bird's wing
is painted; and if Nature is not bold at her work, do you think you ought to be at yours? So
never mind what people say, but work with your pencil point very patiently; and if you can
trust me in anything, trust me when I tell you, that though there are all kinds and ways of
art,--large work for large places, small work for narrow places, slow work for people who can
wait, and quick work for people who cannot,--there is one quality, and, I think, only one,
in which all great and good art agrees;--it is all delicate art. Coarse art is always bad art.
You cannot understand this at present, because you do not know yet how much tender thought,
and subtle care, the great painters put into touches that at first look coarse; but, believe
me, it is true, and you will find it is so in due time.

You will be perhaps also troubled, in these first essays at pencil drawing, by noticing that
more delicate gradations are got in an instant by a chance touch of the India-rubber, than
by an hour's labour with the point; and you may wonder why I tell you to produce tints so painfully,
which might, it appears, be obtained with ease. But there are two reasons: the first, that
when you come to draw forms, you must be able to gradate with absolute precision, in whatever
place and direction you wish; not in any wise vaguely, as the India-rubber does it; and, secondly,
that all natural shadows are more or less mingled with gleams of light. In the darkness of
ground there is the light of the little pebbles or dust; in the darkness of foliage, the glitter
of the leaves; in the darkness of flesh, transparency; in that of a stone, granulation: in
every case there is some mingling of light, which cannot be represented by the leaden tone
which you get by rubbing, or by an instrument known to artists as the "stump." When you can
manage the point properly, you will indeed be able to do much also with this instrument, or
with your fingers; but then you will have to retouch the flat tints afterwards, so as to put
life and light into them, and that can only be done with the point. Labour on, therefore, courageously,
with that only.

EXERCISE V.

When you can manage to tint and gradate tenderly with the pencil point, get a good large alphabet,
and try to tint the letters into shape with the pencil point. Do not outline them first, but
measure their height and extreme breadth with the compasses, as a b, a c, Fig. 3., and then
scratch in their shapes gradually; the letter A, enclosed within the lines, being in what Turner
would have called a "state of forwardness."

Then, when you are satisfied with the shape of the letter, draw pen and ink lines firmly round
the tint, as at d, and remove any touches outside the limit, first with the India-rubber, and
then with the penknife, so that all may look clear and right. If you rub out any of the pencil
inside the outline of the letter, retouch it, closing it up to the inked line. The straight
lines of the outline are all to be ruled,[203] but the curved lines are to be drawn by the
eye and hand; and you will soon find what good practice there is in getting the curved letters,
such as Bs, Cs, &c., to stand quite straight, and come into accurate form.

All these exercises are very irksome, and they are not to be persisted in alone; neither is
it necessary to acquire perfect power in any of them. An entire master of the pencil or brush
ought, indeed, to be able to draw any form at once, as Giotto his circle; but such skill as
this is only to be expected of the consummate master, having pencil in hand all his life, and
all day long, hence the force of Giotto's proof of his skill; and it is quite possible to draw
very beautifully, without attaining even an approximation to such a power; the main point being,
not that every line should be precisely what we intend or wish, but that the line which we
intended or wished to draw should be right. If we always see rightly and mean rightly, we shall
get on, though the hand may stagger a little; but if we mean wrongly, or mean nothing, it does
not matter how firm the hand is. Do not, therefore, torment yourself because you cannot do
as well as you would like; but work patiently, sure that every square and letter will give
you a certain increase of power; and as soon as you can draw your letters pretty well, here
is a more amusing exercise for you.

EXERCISE VI.

Choose any tree that you think pretty, which is nearly bare of leaves, and which you can see
against the sky, or against a pale wall, or other light ground: it must not be against strong
light, or you will find the looking at it hurts your eyes; nor must it be in sunshine, or you
will be puzzled by the lights on the boughs. But the tree must be in shade; and the sky blue,
or grey, or dull white. A wholly grey or rainy day is the best for this practice.

You will see that all the boughs of the tree are dark against the sky. Consider them as so
many dark rivers, to be laid down in a map with absolute accuracy; and, without the least thought
about the roundness of the stems, map them all out in flat shade, scrawling them in with pencil,
just as you did the limbs of your letters; then correct and alter them, rubbing out and out
again, never minding how much your paper is dirtied (only not destroying its surface), until
every bough is exactly, or as near as your utmost power can bring it, right in curvature and
in thickness. Look at the white interstices between them with as much scrupulousness as if
they were little estates which you had to survey, and draw maps of, for some important lawsuit,
involving heavy penalties if you cut the least bit of a corner off any of them, or gave the
hedge anywhere too deep a curve; and try continually to fancy the whole tree nothing but a
flat ramification on a white ground. Do not take any trouble about the little twigs, which
look like a confused network or mist; leave them all out,[204] drawing only the main branches
as far as you can see them distinctly, your object at present being not to draw a tree, but
to learn how to do so. When you have got the thing as nearly right as you can--and it is better
to make one good study than twenty left unnecessarily inaccurate--take your pen, and put a
fine outline to all the boughs, as you did to your letter, taking care, as far as possible,
to put the outline within the edge of the shade, so as not to make the boughs thicker: the
main use of the outline is to affirm the whole more clearly; to do away with little accidental
roughnesses and excrescences, and especially to mark where boughs cross, or come in front of
each other, as at such points their arrangement in this kind of sketch is unintelligible without
the outline. It may perfectly well happen that in Nature it should be less distinct than your
outline will make it; but it is better in this kind of sketch to mark the facts clearly. The
temptation is always to be slovenly and careless, and the outline is like a bridle, and forces
our indolence into attention and precision. The outline should be about the thickness of that
in Fig. 4, which represents the ramification of a small stone pine, only I have not endeavoured
to represent the pencil shading within the outline, as I could not easily express it in a woodcut;
and you have nothing to do at present with the indication of the foliage above, of which in
another place. You may also draw your trees as much larger than this figure as you like; only,
however large they may be, keep the outline as delicate, and draw the branches far enough into
their outer sprays to give quite as slender ramification as you have in this figure, otherwise
you do not get good enough practice out of them.

You cannot do too many studies of this kind: every one will give you some new notion about
trees: but when you are tired of tree boughs, take any forms whatever which are drawn in flat
colour, one upon another; as patterns on any kind of cloth, or flat china (tiles, for instance),
executed in two colours only; and practice drawing them of the right shape and size by the
eye, and filling them in with shade of the depth required.

In doing this, you will first have to meet the difficulty of representing depth of colour by
depth of shade. Thus a pattern of ultramarine blue will have to be represented by a darker
tint of grey than a pattern of yellow.

And now it is both time for you to begin to learn the mechanical use of the brush, and necessary
for you to do so in order to provide yourself with the gradated scale of colour which you will
want. If you can, by any means, get acquainted with any ordinarily skilful water-colour painter,
and prevail on him to show you how to lay on tints with a brush, by all means do so; not that
you are yet, nor for a long while yet, to begin to colour, but because the brush is often more
convenient than the pencil for laying on masses or tints of shade, and the sooner you know
how to manage it as an instrument the better. If, however, you have no opportunity of seeing
how water-colour is laid on by a workman of any kind, the following directions will help you:--

EXERCISE VII.

Get a shilling cake of Prussian blue. Dip the end of it in water so as to take up a drop, and
rub it in a white saucer till you cannot rub much more, and the colour gets dark, thick, and
oily-looking. Put two teaspoonfuls of water to the colour you have rubbed down, and mix it
well up with a camel's-hair brush about three quarters of an inch long.

Then take a piece of smooth, but not glossy, Bristol board or pasteboard; divide it, with your
pencil and rule, into squares as large as those of the very largest chess-board: they need
not be perfect squares, only as nearly so as you can quickly guess. Rest the pasteboard on
something sloping as much as an ordinary desk; then, dipping your brush into the colour you
have mixed, and taking up as much of the liquid as it will carry, begin at the top of one of
the squares, and lay a pond or runlet of colour along the top edge. Lead this pond of colour
gradually downwards, not faster at one place than another, but as if you were adding a row
of bricks to a building, all along (only building down instead of up), dipping the brush frequently
so as to keep the colour as full in that, and in as great quantity on the paper, as you can,
so only that it does not run down anywhere in a little stream. But if it should, never mind;
go on quietly with your square till you have covered it all in. When you get to the bottom,
the colour will lodge there in a great wave. Have ready a piece of blotting-paper; dry your
brush on it, and with the dry brush take up the superfluous colour as you would with a sponge,
till it all looks even.

In leading the colour down, you will find your brush continually go over the edge of the square,
or leave little gaps within it. Do not endeavour to retouch these, nor take much care about
them; the great thing is to get the colour to lie smoothly where it reaches, not in alternate
blots and pale patches; try, therefore, to lead it over the square as fast as possible, with
such attention to your limit as you are able to give. The use of the exercise is, indeed, to
enable you finally to strike the colour up to the limit with perfect accuracy; but the first
thing is to get it even, the power of rightly striking the edge comes only by time and practice;
even the greatest artists rarely can do this quite perfectly.

When you have done one square, proceed to do another which does not communicate with it. When
you have thus done all the alternate squares, as on a chess-board, turn the pasteboard upside
down, begin again with the first, and put another coat over it, and so on over all the others.
The use of turning the paper upside down is to neutralise the increase of darkness towards
the bottom of the squares, which would otherwise take place from the ponding of the colour.

Be resolved to use blotting-paper, or a piece of rag, instead of your lips, to dry the brush.
The habit of doing so, once acquired, will save you from much partial poisoning. Take care,
however, always to draw the brush from root to point, otherwise you will spoil it. You may
even wipe it as you would a pen when you want it very dry, without doing harm, provided you
do not crush it upwards. Get a good brush at first, and cherish it; it will serve you longer
and better than many bad ones.

When you have done the squares all over again, do them a third time, always trying to keep
your edges as neat as possible. When your colour is exhausted, mix more in the same proportions,
two teaspoonfuls to as much as you can grind with a drop; and when you have done the alternate
squares three times over, as the paper will be getting very damp, and dry more slowly, begin
on the white squares, and bring them up to the same tint in the same way. The amount of jagged
dark line which then will mark the limits of the squares will be the exact measure of your
unskilfulness.

As soon as you tire of squares draw circles (with compasses); and then draw straight lines
irregularly across circles, and fill up the spaces so produced between the straight line and
the circumference; and then draw any simple shapes of leaves, according to the exercise No.
2., and fill up those, until you can lay on colour quite evenly in any shape you want.

You will find in the course of this practice, as you cannot always put exactly the same quantity
of water to the colour, that the darker the colour is, the more difficult it becomes to lay
it on evenly. Therefore, when you have gained some definite degree of power, try to fill in
the forms required with a full brush, and a dark tint, at once, instead of laying several coats
one over another; always taking care that the tint, however dark, be quite liquid; and that,
after being laid on, so much of it is absorbed as to prevent its forming a black line at the
edge as it dries. A little experience will teach you how apt the colour is to do this, and
how to prevent it; not that it needs always to be prevented, for a great master in water-colours
will sometimes draw a firm outline, when he wants one, simply by letting the colour dry in
this way at the edge.

When, however, you begin to cover complicated forms with the darker colour, no rapidity will
prevent the tint from drying irregularly as it is led on from part to part. You will then find
the following method useful. Lay in the colour very pale and liquid; so pale, indeed, that
you can only just see where it is on the paper. Lead it up to all the outlines, and make it
precise in form, keeping it thoroughly wet everywhere. Then, when it is all in shape, take
the darker colour, and lay some of it into the middle of the liquid colour. It will spread
gradually in a branchy kind of way, and you may now lead it up to the outlines already determined,
and play it with the brush till it fills its place well; then let it dry, and it will be as
flat and pure as a single dash, yet defining all the complicated forms accurately.

Having thus obtained the power of laying on a tolerably flat tint, you must try to lay on a
gradated one. Prepare the colour with three or four teaspoonfuls of water; then, when it is
mixed, pour away about two-thirds of it, keeping a teaspoonful of pale colour. Sloping your
paper as before, draw two pencil lines all the way down, leaving a space between them of the
width of a square on your chess-board. Begin at the top of your paper, between the lines; and
having struck on the first brushful of colour, and led it down a little, dip your brush deep
in water, and mix up the colour on the plate quickly with as much more water as the brush takes
up at that one dip: then, with this paler colour, lead the tint farther down. Dip in water
again, mix the colour again, and thus lead down the tint, always dipping in water once between
each replenishing of the brush, and stirring the colour on the plate well, but as quickly as
you can. Go on until the colour has become so pale that you cannot see it; then wash your brush
thoroughly in water, and carry the wave down a little farther with that, and then absorb it
with the dry brush, and leave it to dry.

If you get to the bottom of your paper before your colour gets pale, you may either take longer
paper, or begin, with the tint as it was when you left off, on another sheet; but be sure to
exhaust it to pure whiteness at last. When all is quite dry, recommence at the top with another
similar mixture of colour, and go down in the same way. Then again, and then again, and so
continually until the colour at the top of the paper is as dark as your cake of Prussian blue,
and passes down into pure white paper at the end of your column, with a perfectly smooth gradation
from one into the other.

You will find at first that the paper gets mottled or wavy, instead of evenly gradated; this
is because at some places you have taken up more water in your brush than at others, or not
mixed it thoroughly on the plate, or led one tint too far before replenishing with the next.
Practice only will enable you to do it well; the best artists cannot always get gradations
of this kind quite to their minds; nor do they ever leave them on their pictures without after
touching.

As you get more power, and can strike the colour more quickly down, you will be able to gradate
in less compass;[205] beginning with a small quantity of colour, and adding a drop of water,
instead of a brushful; with finer brushes, also, you may gradate to a less scale. But slight
skill will enable you to test the relations of colour to shade as far as is necessary for your
immediate progress, which is to be done thus:--

Take cakes of lake, of gamboge, of sepia, of blue-black, of cobalt, and vermilion; and prepare
gradated columns (exactly as you have done with the Prussian blue) of the lake and blue-black.[206]
Cut a narrow slip all the way down, of each gradated colour, and set the three slips side by
side; fasten them down, and rule lines at equal distances across all the three, so as to divide
them into fifty degrees, and number the degrees of each, from light to dark, 1, 2, 3, &c. If
you have gradated them rightly, the darkest part either of the red or blue will be nearly equal
in power to the darkest part of the blue-black, and any degree of the black slip will also,
accurately enough for our purpose, balance in weight the degree similarly numbered in the red
or the blue slip. Then, when you are drawing from objects of a crimson or blue colour, if you
can match their colour by any compartment of the crimson or blue in your scales, the grey in
the compartment of the grey scale marked with the same number is the grey which must represent
that crimson or blue in your light and shade drawing.

Next, prepare scales with gamboge, cobalt, and vermilion. You will find that you cannot darken
these beyond a certain point;[207] for yellow and scarlet, so long as they remain yellow and
scarlet, cannot approach to black; we cannot have, properly speaking, a dark yellow or dark
scarlet. Make your scales of full yellow, blue, and scarlet, half-way down; passing then gradually
to white. Afterwards use lake to darken the upper half of the vermilion and gamboge; and Prussian
blue to darken the cobalt. You will thus have three more scales, passing from white nearly
to black, through yellow and orange, through sky-blue, and through scarlet. By mixing the gamboge
and Prussian blue you may make another with green; mixing the cobalt and lake, another with
violet; the sepia alone will make a forcible brown one; and so on, until you have as many scales
as you like, passing from black to white through different colours. Then, supposing your scales
properly gradated and equally divided, the compartment or degree No. 1. of the grey will represent
in chiaroscuro the No. 1. of all the other colours; No. 2. of grey the No. 2. of the other
colours, and so on.

It is only necessary, however, in this matter that you should understand the principle; for
it would never be possible for you to gradate your scales so truly as to make them practically
accurate and serviceable; and even if you could, unless you had about ten thousand scales,
and were able to change them faster than ever juggler changed cards, you could not in a day
measure the tints on so much as one side of a frost-bitten apple: but when once you fully understand
the principle, and see how all colours contain as it were a certain quantity of darkness, or
power of dark relief from white--some more, some less; and how this pitch or power of each
may be represented by equivalent values of grey, you will soon be able to arrive shrewdly at
an approximation by a glance of the eye, without any measuring scale at all.

You must now go on, again with the pen, drawing patterns, and any shapes of shade that you
think pretty, as veinings in marble, or tortoise-shell, spots in surfaces of shells, &c., as
tenderly as you can, in the darknesses that correspond to their colours; and when you find
you can do this successfully, it is time to begin rounding.

EXERCISE VIII.

Go out into your garden, or into the road, and pick up the first round or oval stone you can
find, not very white, nor very dark; and the smoother it is the better, only it must not shine.
Draw your table near the window, and put the stone, which I will suppose is about the size
of a in Fig. 5. (it had better not be much larger), on a piece of not very white paper, on
the table in front of you. Sit so that the light may come from your left, else the shadow of
the pencil point interferes with your sight of your work. You must not let the sun fall on
the stone, but only ordinary light: therefore choose a window which the sun does not come in
at. If you can shut the shutters of the other windows in the room it will be all the better;
but this is not of much consequence.

Now, if you can draw that stone, you can draw anything: I mean, anything that is drawable.
Many things (sea foam, for instance) cannot be drawn at all, only the idea of them more or
less suggested; but if you can draw the stone rightly, every thing within reach of art is also
within yours.

For all drawing depends, primarily, on your power of representing Roundness. If you can once
do that, all the rest is easy and straightforward; if you cannot do that, nothing else that
you may be able to do will be of any use. For Nature is all made up of roundnesses; not the
roundness of perfect globes, but of variously curved surfaces. Boughs are rounded, leaves are
rounded, stones are rounded, clouds are rounded, cheeks are rounded, and curls are rounded:
there is no more flatness in the natural world than there is vacancy. The world itself is round,
and so is all that is in it, more or less, except human work, which is often very flat indeed.

Therefore, set yourself steadily to conquer that round stone, and you have won the battle.

Look your stone antagonist boldly in the face. You will see that the side of it next the window
is lighter than most of the paper: that the side of it farthest from the window is darker than
the paper; and that the light passes into the dark gradually, while a shadow is thrown to the
right on the paper itself by the stone: the general appearance of things being more or less
as in a, Fig. 5., the spots on the stone excepted, of which more presently.

Now, remember always what was stated in the outset, that every thing you can see in Nature
is seen only so far as it is lighter or darker than the things about it, or of a different
colour from them. It is either seen as a patch of one colour on a ground of another; or as
a pale thing relieved from a dark thing, or a dark thing from a pale thing. And if you can
put on patches of colour or shade of exactly the same size, shape, and gradations as those
on the object and its ground, you will produce the appearance of the object and its ground.
The best draughtsman--Titian and Paul Veronese themselves--could do no more than this; and
you will soon be able to get some power of doing it in an inferior way, if you once understand
the exceeding simplicity of what is to be done. Suppose you have a brown book on a white sheet
of paper, on a red tablecloth. You have nothing to do but to put on spaces of red, white, and
brown, in the same shape, and gradated from dark to light in the same degrees, and your drawing
is done. If you will not look at what you see, if you try to put on brighter or duller colours
than are there, if you try to put them on with a dash or a blot, or to cover your paper with
"vigorous" lines, or to produce anything, in fact, but the plain, unaffected, and finished
tranquillity of the thing before you, you need not hope to get on. Nature will show you nothing
if you set yourself up for her master. But forget yourself, and try to obey her, and you will
find obedience easier and happier than you think.

The real difficulties are to get the refinement of the forms and the evenness of the gradations.
You may depend upon it, when you are dissatisfied with your work, it is always too coarse or
too uneven. It may not be wrong--in all probability is not wrong, in any (so-called) great
point. But its edges are not true enough in outline; and its shades are in blotches, or scratches,
or full of white holes. Get it more tender and more true, and you will find it is more powerful.

Do not, therefore, think your drawing must be weak because you have a finely pointed pen in
your hand. Till you can draw with that, you can draw with nothing; when you can draw with that,
you can draw with a log of wood charred at the end. True boldness and power are only to be
gained by care. Even in fencing and dancing, all ultimate ease depends on early precision in
the commencement; much more in singing or drawing.

Now, I do not want you to copy Fig. 5., but to copy the stone before you in the way that Fig.
5. is done. To which end, first measure the extreme length of the stone with compasses, and
mark that length on your paper; then, between the points marked, leave something like the form
of the stone in light, scrawling the paper all over, round it, as at b, Fig. 5. You cannot
rightly see what the form of the stone really is till you begin finishing, so sketch it in
quite rudely; only rather leave too much room for the high light, than too little: and then
more cautiously fill in the shade, shutting the light gradually up, and putting in the dark
cautiously on the dark side. You need not plague yourself about accuracy of shape, because,
till you have practised a great deal, it is impossible for you to draw that shape quite truly,
and you must gradually gain correctness by means of these various exercises: what you have
mainly to do at present is, to get the stone to look solid and round, not much minding what
its exact contour is--only draw it as nearly right as you can without vexation; and you will
get it more right by thus feeling your way to it in shade, than if you tried to draw the outline
at first. For you can see no outline; what you see is only a certain space of gradated shade,
with other such spaces about it; and those pieces of shade you are to imitate as nearly as
you can, by scrawling the paper over till you get them to the right shape, with the same gradations
which they have in Nature. And this is really more likely to be done well, if you have to fight
your way through a little confusion in the sketch, than if you have an accurately traced outline.
For instance, I was going to draw, beside a, another effect on the stone; reflected light bringing
its dark side out from the background: but when I had laid on the first few touches, I thought
it would be better to stop, and let you see how I had begun it, at b. In which beginning it
will be observed that nothing is so determined but that I can more or less modify, and add
to or diminish the contour as I work on, the lines which suggest the outline being blended
with the others if I do not want them; and the having to fill up the vacancies and conquer
the irregularities of such a sketch, will probably secure a higher completion at last, than
if half an hour had been spent in getting a true outline before beginning.

In doing this, however, take care not to get the drawing too dark. In order to ascertain what
the shades of it really are, cut a round hole, about half the size of a pea, in a piece of
white paper, the colour of that you use to draw on. Hold this bit of paper, with the hole in
it, between you and your stone; and pass the paper backwards and forwards, so as to see the
different portions of the stone (or other subject) through the hole. You will find that, thus,
the circular hole looks like one of the patches of colour you have been accustomed to match,
only changing in depth as it lets different pieces of the stone be seen through it. You will
be able thus actually to match the colour of the stone, at any part of it, by tinting the paper
beside the circular opening. And you will find that this opening never looks quite black, but
that all the roundings of the stone are given by subdued greys.[208]

You will probably find, also, that some parts of the stone, or of the paper it lies on, look
luminous through the opening, so that the little circle then tells as a light spot instead
of a dark spot. When this is so, you cannot imitate it, for you have no means of getting light
brighter than white paper: but by holding the paper more sloped towards the light, you will
find that many parts of the stone, which before looked light through the hole, then look dark
through it; and if you can place the paper in such a position that every part of the stone
looks slightly dark, the little hole will tell always as a spot of shade, and if your drawing
is put in the same light, you can imitate or match every gradation. You will be amazed to find,
under these circumstances, how slight the differences of tint are, by which, through infinite
delicacy of gradation, Nature can express form.

If any part of your subject will obstinately show itself as a light through the hole, that
part you need not hope to imitate. Leave it white, you can do no more.

When you have done the best you can to get the general form, proceed to finish, by imitating
the texture and all the cracks and stains of the stone as closely as you can; and note, in
doing this, that cracks or fissures of any kind, whether between stones in walls, or in the
grain of timber or rocks, or in any of the thousand other conditions they present, are never
expressible by single black lines, or lines of simple shadow. A crack must always have its
complete system of light and shade, however small its scale. It is in reality a little ravine,
with a dark or shady side, and light or sunny side, and, usually, shadow in the bottom. This
is one of the instances in which it may be as well to understand the reason of the appearance;
it is not often so in drawing, for the aspects of things are so subtle and confused that they
cannot in general be explained; and in the endeavour to explain some, we are sure to lose sight
of others, while the natural overestimate of the importance of those on which the attention
is fixed, causes us to exaggerate them, so that merely scientific draughtsmen caricature a
third part of Nature, and miss two-thirds. The best scholar is he whose eye is so keen as to
see at once how the thing looks, and who need not, therefore, trouble himself with any reasons
why it looks so: but few people have this acuteness of perception; and to those who are destitute
of it, a little pointing out of rule and reason will be a help, especially when a master is
not near them. I never allow my own pupils to ask the reason of anything, because, as I watch
their work, I can always show them how the thing is, and what appearance they are missing in
it; but when a master is not by to direct the sight, science may, here and there, be allowed
to do so in his stead.

Generally, then, every solid illumined object--for instance, the stone you are drawing--has
a light side turned towards the light, a dark side turned away from the light, and a shadow,
which is cast on something else (as by the stone on the paper it is set upon). You may sometimes
be placed so as to see only the light side and shadow, and sometimes only the dark side and
shadow, and sometimes both, or either, without the shadow; but in most positions solid objects
will show all the three, as the stone does here.

Hold up your hand with the edge of it towards you, as you sit now with your side to the window,
so that the flat of your hand is turned to the window. You will see one side of your hand distinctly
lighted, the other distinctly in shade. Here are light side and dark side, with no seen shadow;
the shadow being detached, perhaps on the table, perhaps on the other side of the room; you
need not look for it at present.

Take a sheet of note-paper, and holding it edgeways, as you hold your hand, wave it up and
down past the side of your hand which is turned from the light, the paper being, of course,
farther from the window. You will see, as it passes a strong gleam of light strike on your
hand, and light it considerably on its dark side. This light is reflected light. It is thrown
back from the paper (on which it strikes first in coming from the window) to the surface of
your hand, just as a ball would be if somebody threw it through the window at the wall and
you caught it at the rebound.

Next, instead of the note-paper, take a red book, or a piece of scarlet cloth. You will see
that the gleam of light falling on your hand, as you wave the book is now reddened. Take a
blue book, and you will find the gleam is blue. Thus every object will cast some of its own
colour back in the light that it reflects.

Now it is not only these books or papers that reflect light to your hand: every object in the
room, on that side of it, reflects some, but more feebly, and the colours mixing all together
form a neutral[209] light, which lets the colour of your hand itself be more distinctly seen
than that of any object which reflects light to it; but if there were no reflected light, that
side of your hand would look as black as a coal.

Objects are seen, therefore in general, partly by direct light, and partly by light reflected
from the objects around them, or from the atmosphere and clouds. The colour of their light
sides depends much on that of the direct light, and that of the dark sides on the colours of
the objects near them. It is therefore impossible to say beforehand what colour an object will
have at any point of its surface, that colour depending partly on its own tint, and partly
on infinite combinations of rays reflected from other things. The only certain fact about dark
sides is, that their colour will be changeful, and that a picture which gives them merely darker
shades of the colour of the light sides must assuredly be bad.

Now, lay your hand flat on the white paper you are drawing on. You will see one side of each
finger lighted, one side dark, and the shadow of your hand on the paper. Here, therefore, are
the three divisions of shade seen at once. And although the paper is white, and your hand of
a rosy colour somewhat darker than white, yet you will see that the shadow all along, just
under the finger which casts it, is darker than the flesh, and is of a very deep grey. The
reason of this is, that much light is reflected from the paper to the dark side of your finger,
but very little is reflected from other things to the paper itself in that chink under your finger.

In general, for this reason, a shadow, or, at any rate, the part of the shadow nearest the
object, is darker than the dark side of the object. I say in general, because a thousand accidents
may interfere to prevent its being so. Take a little bit of glass, as a wine-glass, or the
ink-bottle, and play it about a little on the side of your hand farthest from the window; you
will presently find you are throwing gleams of light all over the dark side of your hand, and
in some positions of the glass the reflection from it will annihilate the shadow altogether,
and you will see your hand dark on the white paper. Now a stupid painter would represent, for
instance, a drinking-glass beside the hand of one of his figures, and because he had been taught
by rule that "shadow was darker than the dark side," he would never think of the reflection
from the glass, but paint a dark grey under the hand, just as if no glass were there. But a
great painter would be sure to think of the true effect, and paint it; and then comes the stupid
critic, and wonders why the hand is so light on its dark side.

Thus it is always dangerous to assert anything as a rule in matters of art; yet it is useful
for you to remember that, in a general way, a shadow is darker than the dark side of the thing
that casts it, supposing the colours otherwise the same; that is to say, when a white object
casts a shadow on a white surface, or a dark object on a dark surface: the rule will not hold
if the colours are different, the shadow of a black object on a white surface being, of course,
not so dark, usually, as the black thing casting it. The only way to ascertain the ultimate
truth in such matters is to look for it; but, in the meantime, you will be helped by noticing
that the cracks in the stone are little ravines, on one side of which the light strikes sharply,
while the other is in shade. This dark side usually casts a little darker shadow at the bottom
of the crack; and the general tone of the stone surface is not so bright as the light bank
of the ravine. And, therefore, if you get the surface of the object of a uniform tint, more
or less indicative of shade, and then scratch out a white spot or streak in it of any shape;
by putting a dark touch beside this white one, you may turn it, as you choose, into either
a ridge or an incision, into either a boss or a cavity. If you put the dark touch on the side
of it nearest the sun, or rather, nearest the place that the light comes from, you will make
it a cut or cavity; if you put it on the opposite side, you will make it a ridge or mound:
and the complete success of the effect depends less on depth of shade than on the rightness
of the drawing; that is to say, on the evident correspondence of the form of the shadow with
the form that casts it. In drawing rocks, or wood, or anything irregularly shaped, you will
gain far more by a little patience in following the forms carefully, though with slight touches,
than by laboured finishing of textures of surface and transparencies of shadow.

When you have got the whole well into shape, proceed to lay on the stains and spots with great
care, quite as much as you gave to the forms. Very often, spots or bars of local colour do
more to express form than even the light and shade, and they are always interesting as the
means by which Nature carries light into her shadows, and shade into her lights, an art of
which we shall have more to say hereafter, in speaking of composition. Fig. 5. is a rough sketch
of a fossil sea-urchin, in which the projections of the shell are of black flint, coming through
a chalky surface. These projections form dark spots in the light; and their sides, rising out
of the shadow, form smaller whitish spots in the dark. You may take such scattered lights as
these out with the penknife, provided you are just as careful to place them rightly, as if
you got them by a more laborious process.

When you have once got the feeling of the way in which gradation expresses roundness and projection,
you may try your strength on anything natural or artificial that happens to take your fancy,
provided it be not too complicated in form. I have asked you to draw a stone first, because
any irregularities and failures in your shading will be less offensive to you, as being partly
characteristic of the rough stone surface, than they would be in a more delicate subject; and
you may as well go on drawing rounded stones of different shapes for a little while, till you
find you can really shade delicately. You may then take up folds of thick white drapery, a
napkin or towel thrown carelessly on the table is as good as anything, and try to express them
in the same way; only now you will find that your shades must be wrought with perfect unity
and tenderness, or you will lose the flow of the folds. Always remember that a little bit perfected
is worth more than many scrawls; whenever you feel yourself inclined to scrawl, give up work
resolutely, and do not go back to it till next day. Of course your towel or napkin must be
put on something that may be locked up, so that its folds shall not be disturbed till you have
finished. If you find that the folds will not look right, get a photograph of a piece of drapery
(there are plenty now to be bought, taken from the sculpture of the cathedrals of Rheims, Amiens,
and Chartres, which will at once educate your hand and your taste), and copy some piece of
that; you will then ascertain what it is that is wanting in your studies from nature, whether
more gradation, or greater watchfulness of the disposition of the folds. Probably for some
time you will find yourself failing painfully in both, for drapery is very difficult to follow
in its sweeps; but do not lose courage, for the greater the difficulty, the greater the gain
in the effort. If your eye is more just in measurement of form than delicate in perception
of tint, a pattern on the folded surface will help you. Try whether it does or not; and if
the patterned drapery confuses you, keep for a time to the simple white one; but if it helps
you, continue to choose patterned stuffs (tartans, and simple chequered designs are better
at first than flowered ones), and even though it should confuse you, begin pretty soon to use
a pattern occasionally, copying all the distortions and perspective modifications of it among
the folds with scrupulous care.

Neither must you suppose yourself condescending in doing this. The greatest masters are always
fond of drawing patterns; and the greater they are, the more pains they take to do it truly.[210]
Nor can there be better practice at any time, as introductory to the nobler complication of
natural detail. For when you can draw the spots which follow the folds of a printed stuff,
you will have some chance of following the spots which fall into the folds of the skin of a
leopard as he leaps; but if you cannot draw the manufacture, assuredly you will never be able
to draw the creature. So the cloudings on a piece of wood, carefully drawn, will be the best
introduction to the drawing of the clouds of the sky, or the waves of the sea; and the dead
leaf-patterns on a damask drapery, well rendered, will enable you to disentangle masterfully
the living leaf-patterns of a thorn thicket, or a violet bank.

Observe, however, in drawing any stuffs, or bindings of books, or other finely textured substances,
do not trouble yourself, as yet, much about the woolliness or gauziness of the thing; but get
it right in shade and fold, and true in pattern. We shall see, in the course of after-practice,
how the penned lines may be made indicative of texture; but at present attend only to the light,
and shade, and pattern. You will be puzzled at first by lustrous surfaces, but a little attention
will show you that the expression of these depends merely on the right drawing of their light,
and shade, and reflections. Put a small black japanned tray on the table in front of some books;
and you will see it reflects the objects beyond it as in a little black rippled pond; its own
colour mingling always with that of the reflected objects. Draw these reflections of the books
properly, making them dark and distorted, as you will see that they are, and you will find
that this gives the lustre to your tray. It is not well, however, to draw polished objects
in general practice; only you should do one or two in order to understand the aspect of any
lustrous portion of other things, such as you cannot avoid; the gold, for instance, on the
edges of books, or the shining of silk and damask, in which lies a great part of the expression
of their folds. Observe, also, that there are very few things which are totally without lustre:
you will frequently find a light which puzzles you, on some apparently dull surface, to be
the dim image of another object.

And now, as soon as you can conscientiously assure me that with the point of the pen or pencil
you can lay on any form and shade you like, I give you leave to use the brush with one colour,--sepia,
or blue-black, or mixed cobalt and blue-black, or neutral tint; and this will much facilitate
your study, and refresh you. But, preliminarily, you must do one or two more exercises in tinting.

EXERCISE IX.

Prepare your colour as before directed. Take a brush full of it, and strike it on the paper
in any irregular shape; as the brush gets dry sweep the surface of the paper with it as if
you were dusting the paper very lightly; every such sweep of the brush will leave a number
of more or less minute interstices in the colour. The lighter and faster every dash the better.
Then leave the whole to dry, and as soon as it is dry, with little colour in your brush, so
that you can bring it to a fine point, fill up all the little interstices one by one, so as
to make the whole as even as you can, and fill in the larger gaps with more colour, always
trying to let the edges of the first and of the newly applied colour exactly meet, and not
lap over each other. When your new colour dries, you will find it in places a little paler
than the first. Retouch it, therefore, trying to get the whole to look quite one piece. A very
small bit of colour thus filled up with your very best care, and brought to look as if it had
been quite even from the first, will give you better practice and more skill than a great deal
filled in carelessly; so do it with your best patience, not leaving the most minute spot of
white; and do not fill in the large pieces first and then go to the small, but quietly and
steadily cover in the whole up to a marked limit; then advance a little farther, and so on;
thus always seeing distinctly what is done and what undone.

EXERCISE X.

Lay a coat of the blue, prepared as usual, over a whole square of paper. Let it dry. Then another
coat over four-fifths of the square, or thereabouts, leaving the edge rather irregular than
straight, and let it dry. Then another coat over three-fifths; another over two-fifths; and
the last over one-fifth; so that the square may present the appearance of gradual increase
in darkness in five bands, each darker than the one beyond it. Then, with the brush rather
dry (as in the former exercise, when filling up the interstices), try, with small touches,
like those used in the pen etching, only a little broader, to add shade delicately beyond each
edge, so as to lead the darker tints into the paler ones imperceptibly. By touching the paper
very lightly, and putting a multitude of little touches, crossing and recrossing in every direction,
you will gradually be able to work up to the darker tints, outside of each, so as quite to
efface their edges, and unite them tenderly with the next tint. The whole square, when done,
should look evenly shaded from dark to pale, with no bars; only a crossing texture of touches,
something like chopped straw, over the whole.[211]

Next, take your rounded pebble; arrange it in any light and shade you like; outline it very
loosely with the pencil. Put on a wash of colour, prepared very pale, quite flat over all of
it, except the highest light, leaving the edge of your colour quite sharp. Then another wash,
extending only over the darker parts, leaving the edge of that sharp also, as in tinting the
square. Then another wash over the still darker parts, and another over the darkest, leaving
each edge to dry sharp. Then, with the small touches, efface the edges, reinforce the darks,
and work the whole delicately together, as you would with the pen, till you have got it to
the likeness of the true light and shade. You will find that the tint underneath is a great
help, and that you can now get effects much more subtle and complete than with the pen merely.

The use of leaving the edges always sharp is that you may not trouble or vex the colour, but
let it lie as it falls suddenly on the paper; colour looks much more lovely when it has been
laid on with a dash of the brush, and left to dry in its own way, than when it has been dragged
about and disturbed; so that it is always better to let the edges and forms be a little wrong,
even if one cannot correct them afterwards, than to lose this fresh quality of the tint. Very
great masters in water-colour can lay on the true forms at once with a dash, and bad masters
in water-colour lay on grossly false forms with a dash, and leave them false; for people in
general, not knowing false from true, are as much pleased with the appearance of power in the
irregular blot as with the presence of power in the determined one; but we, in our beginnings,
must do as much as we can with the broad dash, and then correct with the point, till we are
quite right. We must take care to be right, at whatever cost of pains; and then gradually we
shall find we can be right with freedom.

I have hitherto limited you to colour mixed with two or three teaspoonfuls of water; but in
finishing your light and shade from the stone, you may, as you efface the edge of the palest
coat towards the light, use the colour for the small touches with more and more water, till
it is so pale as not to be perceptible. Thus you may obtain a perfect gradation to the light.
And in reinforcing the darks, when they are very dark, you may use less and less water. If
you take the colour tolerably dark on your brush, only always liquid (not pasty), and dash
away the superfluous colour on blotting-paper, you will find that, touching the paper very
lightly with the dry brush, you can, by repeated touches, produce a dusty kind of bloom, very
valuable in giving depth to shadow; but it requires great patience and delicacy of hand to
do this properly. You will find much of this kind of work in the grounds and shadows of William
Hunt's drawings.[212]

As you get used to the brush and colour, you will gradually find out their ways for yourself,
and get the management of them. Nothing but practice will do this perfectly; but you will often
save yourself much discouragement by remembering what I have so often asserted,--that if anything
goes wrong, it is nearly sure to be refinement that is wanting, not force; and connexion, not
alteration. If you dislike the state your drawing is in, do not lose patience with it, nor
dash at it, nor alter its plan, nor rub it desperately out, at the place you think wrong; but
look if there are no shadows you can gradate more perfectly; no little gaps and rents you can
fill; no forms you can more delicately define: and do not rush at any of the errors or incompletions
thus discerned, but efface or supply slowly, and you will soon find your drawing take another
look. A very useful expedient in producing some effects, is to wet the paper, and then lay
the colour on it, more or less wet, according to the effect you want. You will soon see how
prettily it gradates itself as it dries; when dry, you can reinforce it with delicate stippling
when you want it darker. Also, while the colour is still damp on the paper, by drying your
brush thoroughly, and touching the colour with the brush so dried, you may take out soft lights
with great tenderness and precision. Try all sorts of experiments of this kind, noticing how
the colour behaves; but remembering always that your final results must be obtained, and can
only be obtained, by pure work with the point, as much as in the pen drawing.

You will find also, as you deal with more and more complicated subjects, that Nature's resources
in light and shade are so much richer than yours, that you cannot possibly get all, or anything
like all, the gradations of shadow in any given group. When this is the case, determine first
to keep the broad masses of things distinct: if, for instance, there is a green book, and a
white piece of paper, and a black inkstand in the group, be sure to keep the white paper as
a light mass, the green book as a middle tint mass, the black inkstand as a dark mass; and
do not shade the folds in the paper, or corners of the book, so as to equal in depth the darkness
of the inkstand. The great difference between the masters of light and shade, and imperfect
artists, is the power of the former to draw so delicately as to express form in a dark-coloured
object with little light, and in a light-coloured object with little darkness; and it is better
even to leave the forms here and there unsatisfactorily rendered than to lose the general relations
of the great masses. And this observe, not because masses are grand or desirable things in
your composition (for with composition at present you have nothing whatever to do), but because
it is a fact that things do so present themselves to the eyes of men, and that we see paper,
book, and inkstand as three separate things, before we see the wrinkles, or chinks, or corners
of any of the three. Understand, therefore, at once, that no detail can be as strongly expressed
in drawing as it is in the reality; and strive to keep all your shadows and marks and minor
markings on the masses, lighter than they appear to be in Nature, you are sure otherwise to
get them too dark. You will in doing this find that you cannot get the projection of things
sufficiently shown; but never mind that; there is no need that they should appear to project,
but great need that their relations of shade to each other should be preserved. All deceptive
projection is obtained by partial exaggeration of shadow; and whenever you see it, you may
be sure the drawing is more or less bad; a thoroughly fine drawing or painting will always
show a slight tendency towards flatness.

Observe, on the other hand, that however white an object may be, there is always some small
point of it whiter than the rest. You must therefore have a slight tone of grey over everything
in your picture except on the extreme high lights; even the piece of white paper, in your subject,
must be toned slightly down, unless (and there are a thousand chances to one against its being
so) it should all be turned so as fully to front the light. By examining the treatment of the
white objects in any pictures accessible to you by Paul Veronese or Titian, you will soon understand
this.[213]

As soon as you feel yourself capable of expressing with the brush the undulations of surfaces
and the relations of masses, you may proceed to draw more complicated and beautiful things.[214]
And first, the boughs of trees, now not in mere dark relief, but in full rounding. Take the
first bit of branch or stump that comes to hand, with a fork in it; cut off the ends of the
forking branches, so as to leave the whole only about a foot in length; get a piece of paper
the same size, fix your bit of branch in some place where its position will not be altered,
and draw it thoroughly, in all its light and shade, full size; striving, above all things,
to get an accurate expression of its structure at the fork of the branch. When once you have
mastered the tree at its armpits, you will have little more trouble with it.

Always draw whatever the background happens to be, exactly as you see it. Wherever you have
fastened the bough, you must draw whatever is behind it, ugly or not, else you will never know
whether the light and shade are right; they may appear quite wrong to you, only for want of
the background. And this general law is to be observed in all your studies: whatever you draw,
draw completely and unalteringly, else you never know if what you have done is right, or whether
you could have done it rightly had you tried. There is nothing visible out of which you may
not get useful practice.

Next, to put the leaves on your boughs. Gather a small twig with four or five leaves on it,
put it into water, put a sheet of light-coloured or white paper behind it, so that all the
leaves may be relieved in dark from the white field; then sketch in their dark shape carefully
with pencil as you did the complicated boughs, in order to be sure that all their masses and
interstices are right in shape before you begin shading, and complete as far as you can with
pen and ink, in the manner of Fig. 6., which is a young shoot of lilac.

You will probably, in spite of all your pattern drawings, be at first puzzled by leaf foreshortening;
especially because the look of retirement or projection depends not so much on the perspective
of the leaves themselves as on the double sight of the two eyes. Now there are certain artifices
by which good painters can partly conquer this difficulty; as slight exaggerations of force
or colour in the nearer parts, and of obscurity in the more distant ones; but you must not
attempt anything of this kind. When you are first sketching the leaves, shut one of your eyes,
fix a point in the background, to bring the point of one of the leaves against, and so sketch
the whole bough as you see it in a fixed position, looking with one eye only. Your drawing
never can be made to look like the object itself, as you see that object with both eyes,[215]
but it can be made perfectly like the object seen with one, and you must be content when you
have got a resemblance on these terms.

In order to get clearly at the notion of the thing to be done, take a single long leaf, hold
it with its point towards you, and as flat as you can, so as to see nothing of it but its thinness,
as if you wanted to know how thin it was; outline it so. Then slope it down gradually towards
you, and watch it as it lengthens out to its full length, held perpendicularly down before
you. Draw it in three or four different positions between these extremes, with its ribs as
they appear in each position, and you will soon find out how it must be.

Draw first only two or three of the leaves; then larger clusters; and practise, in this way,
more and more complicated pieces of bough and leafage, till you find you can master the most
difficult arrangements, not consisting of more than ten or twelve leaves. You will find as
you do this, if you have an opportunity of visiting any gallery of pictures, that you take
a much more lively interest than before in the work of the great masters; you will see that
very often their best backgrounds are composed of little more than a few sprays of leafage,
carefully studied, brought against the distant sky; and that another wreath or two form the
chief interest of their foregrounds. If you live in London you may test your progress accurately
by the degree of admiration you feel for the leaves of vine round the head of the Bacchus,
in Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne. All this, however, will not enable you to draw a mass of foliage.
You will find, on looking at any rich piece of vegetation, that it is only one or two of the
nearer clusters that you can by any possibility draw in this complete manner. The mass is too
vast, and too intricate, to be thus dealt with.

You must now therefore have recourse to some confused mode of execution, capable of expressing
the confusion of Nature. And, first, you must understand what the character of that confusion
is. If you look carefully at the outer sprays of any tree at twenty or thirty yards' distance,
you will see them defined against the sky in masses, which, at first, look quite definite;
but if you examine them, you will see, mingled with the real shapes of leaves, many indistinct
lines, which are, some of them, stalks of leaves, and some, leaves seen with the edge turned
towards you, and coming into sight in a broken way; for, supposing the real leaf shape to be
as at a, Fig. 7., this, when removed some yards from the eye, will appear dark against the
sky, as at b; then, when removed some yards farther still, the stalk and point disappear altogether,
the middle of the leaf becomes little more than a line; and the result is the condition at
c, only with this farther subtlety in the look of it, inexpressible in the woodcut, that the
stalk and point of the leaf, though they have disappeared to the eye, have yet some influence
in checking the light at the places where they exist, and cause a slight dimness about the
part of the leaf which remains visible, so that its perfect effect could only be rendered by
two layers of colour, one subduing the sky tone a little, the next drawing the broken portions
of the leaf, as at c, and carefully indicating the greater darkness of the spot in the middle,
where the under side of the leaf is.

This is the perfect theory of the matter. In practice we cannot reach such accuracy; but we
shall be able to render the general look of the foliage satisfactorily by the following mode
of practice.

Gather a spray of any tree, about a foot or eighteen inches long. Fix it firmly by the stem
in anything that will support it steadily; put it about eight feet away from you, or ten if
you are far-sighted. Put a sheet of not very white paper behind it, as usual. Then draw very
carefully, first placing them with pencil, and then filling them up with ink, every leaf, mass
and stalk of it in simple black profile, as you see them against the paper: Fig. 8. is a bough
of Phillyrea so drawn. Do not be afraid of running the leaves into a black mass when they come
together; this exercise is only to teach you what the actual shapes of such masses are when
seen against the sky.

Make two careful studies of this kind of one bough of every common tree--oak, ash, elm, birch,
beech, &c.; in fact, if you are good, and industrious, you will make one such study carefully
at least three times a week, until you have examples of every sort of tree and shrub you can
get branches of. You are to make two studies of each bough, for this reason--all masses of
foliage have an upper and under surface, and the side view of them, or profile, shows a wholly
different organisation of branches from that seen in the view from above. They are generally
seen more or less in profile, as you look at the whole tree, and Nature puts her best composition
into the profile arrangement. But the view from above or below occurs not unfrequently, also,
and it is quite necessary you should draw it if you wish to understand the anatomy of the tree.
The difference between the two views is often far greater than you could easily conceive. For
instance, in Fig. 9., a is the upper view, and b the profile, of a single spray of Phillyrea.
Fig. 8. is an intermediate view of a larger bough; seen from beneath, but at some lateral distance
also.

When you have done a few branches in this manner, take one of the drawings, and put it first
a yard away from you, then a yard and a half, then two yards; observe how the thinner stalks
and leaves gradually disappear, leaving only a vague and slight darkness where they were, and
make another study of the effect at each distance, taking care to draw nothing more than you
really see, for in this consists all the difference between what would be merely a miniature
drawing of the leaves seen near, and a full-size drawing of the same leaves at a distance.
By full size, I mean the size which they would really appear of if their outline were traced
through a pane of glass held at the same distance from the eye at which you mean to hold your
drawing. You can always ascertain this full size of any object by holding your paper upright
before you, at the distance from your eye at which you wish your drawing to be seen. Bring
its edge across the object you have to draw, and mark upon this edge the points where the outline
of the object crosses, or goes behind, the edge of the paper. You will always find it, thus
measured, smaller than you supposed.

When you have made a few careful experiments of this kind on your own drawings, (which are
better for practice, at first, than the real trees, because the black profile in the drawing
is quite stable, and does not shake, and is not confused by sparkles of lustre on the leaves,)
you may try the extremities of the real trees, only not doing much at a time, for the brightness
of the sky will dazzle and perplex your sight. And this brightness causes, I believe, some
loss of the outline itself; at least the chemical action of the light in a photograph extends
much within the edges of the leaves, and, as it were, eats them away so that no tree extremity,
stand it ever so still, nor any other form coming against bright sky, is truly drawn by a photograph;
and if you once succeed in drawing a few sprays rightly, you will find the result much more
lovely and interesting than any photograph can be.

All this difficulty, however, attaches to the rendering merely the dark form of the sprays
as they come against the sky. Within those sprays, and in the heart of the tree, there is a
complexity of a much more embarrassing kind; for nearly all leaves have some lustre, and all
are more or less translucent (letting light through them); therefore, in any given leaf, besides
the intricacies of its own proper shadows and foreshortenings, there are three series of circumstances
which alter or hide its forms. First, shadows cast on it by other leaves--often very forcibly.
Secondly, light reflected from its lustrous surface, sometimes the blue of the sky, sometimes
the white of clouds, or the sun itself flashing like a star. Thirdly, forms and shadows of
other leaves, seen as darkness through the translucent parts of the leaf; a most important
element of foliage effect, but wholly neglected by landscape artists in general.

The consequence of all this is, that except now and then by chance, the form of a complete
leaf is never seen; but a marvellous and quaint confusion, very definite, indeed, in its evidence
of direction of growth, and unity of action, but wholly indefinable and inextricable, part
by part, by any amount of patience. You cannot possibly work it out in fac simile, though you
took a twelvemonth's time to a tree; and you must therefore try to discover some mode of execution
which will more or less imitate, by its own variety and mystery, the variety and mystery of
Nature, without absolute delineation of detail.

Now I have led you to this conclusion by observation of tree form only, because in that the
thing to be proved is clearest. But no natural object exists which does not involve in some
part or parts of it this inimitableness, this mystery of quantity, which needs peculiarity
of handling and trick of touch to express it completely. If leaves are intricate, so is moss,
so is foam, so is rock cleavage, so are fur and hair, and texture of drapery, and of clouds.
And although methods and dexterities of handling are wholly useless if you have not gained
first the thorough knowledge of the form of the thing; so that if you cannot draw a branch
perfectly, then much less a tree; and if not a wreath of mist perfectly, much less a flock
of clouds; and if not a single grass blade perfectly, much less a grass bank; yet having once
got this power over decisive form, you may safely--and must, in order to perfection of work--carry
out your knowledge by every aid of method and dexterity of hand.

But, in order to find out what method can do, you must now look at Art as well as at Nature,
and see what means painters and engravers have actually employed for the expression of these
subtleties. Whereupon arises the question, what opportunity have you to obtain engravings?
You ought, if it is at all in your power, to possess yourself of a certain number of good examples
of Turner's engraved works: if this be not in your power, you must just make the best use you
can of the shop windows, or of any plates of which you can obtain a loan. Very possibly, the
difficulty of getting sight of them may stimulate you to put them to better use. But, supposing
your means admit of your doing so, possess yourself, first, of the illustrated edition either
of Rogers's Italy or Rogers's Poems, and then of about a dozen of the plates named in the annexed
lists. The prefixed letters indicate the particular points deserving your study in each engraving.[216]
Be sure, therefore, that your selection includes, at all events, one plate marked with each
letter--of course the plates marked with two or three letters are, for the most part, the best.
Do not get more than twelve of these plates, nor even all the twelve at first. For the more
engravings you have, the less attention you will pay to them. It is a general truth, that the
enjoyment derivable from art cannot be increased in quantity, beyond a certain point, by quantity
of possession; it is only spread, as it were, over a larger surface, and very often dulled
by finding ideas repeated in different works. Now, for a beginner, it is always better that
his attention should be concentrated on one or two good things, and all his enjoyment founded
on them, than that he should look at many, with divided thoughts. He has much to discover;
and his best way of discovering it is to think long over few things, and watch them earnestly.
It is one of the worst errors of this age to try to know and to see too much: the men who seem
to know everything, never in reality know anything rightly. Beware of hand-book knowledge.

These engravings are, in general, more for you to look at than to copy; and they will be of
more use to you when we come to talk of composition, than they are at present; still, it will
do you a great deal of good, sometimes to try how far you can get their delicate texture, or
gradations of tone; as your pen-and-ink drawing will be apt to incline too much to a scratchy
and broken kind of shade. For instance, the texture of the white convent wall, and the drawing
of its tiled roof, in the vignette at p. 227. of Rogers's Poems, is as exquisite as work can
possibly be; and it will be a great and profitable achievement if you can at all approach it.
In like manner, if you can at all imitate the dark distant country at p. 7., or the sky at
p. 80., of the same volume, or the foliage at pp. 12. and 144., it will be good gain; and if
you can once draw the rolling clouds and running river at p. 9. of the "Italy," or the city
in the vignette of Aosta at p. 25., or the moonlight at p. 223., you will find that even Nature
herself cannot afterwards very terribly puzzle you with her torrents, or towers, or moonlight.

You need not copy touch for touch, but try to get the same effect. And if you feel discouraged
by the delicacy required, and begin to think that engraving is not drawing, and that copying
it cannot help you to draw, remember that it differs from common drawing only by the difficulties
it has to encounter. You perhaps have got into a careless habit of thinking that engraving
is a mere business, easy enough when one has got into the knack of it. On the contrary, it
is a form of drawing more difficult than common drawing, by exactly so much as it is more difficult
to cut steel than to move the pencil over paper. It is true that there are certain mechanical
aids and methods which reduce it at certain stages either to pure machine work, or to more
or less a habit of hand and arm; but this is not so in the foliage you are trying to copy,
of which the best and prettiest parts are always etched--that is, drawn with a fine steel point
and free hand: only the line made is white instead of black, which renders it much more difficult
to judge of what you are about. And the trying to copy these plates will be good for you, because
it will awaken you to the real labour and skill of the engraver, and make you understand a
little how people must work, in this world, who have really to do anything in it.

Do not, however, suppose that I give you the engraving as a model--far from it; but it is necessary
you should be able to do as well[217] before you think of doing better, and you will find many
little helps and hints in the various work of it. Only remember that all engravers' foregrounds
are bad; whenever you see the peculiar wriggling parallel lines of modern engravings become
distinct, you must not copy; nor admire: it is only the softer masses, and distances; and portions
of the foliage in the plates marked f, which you may copy. The best for this purpose, if you
can get it, is the "Chain bridge over the Tees," of the England series; the thicket on the
right is very beautiful and instructive, and very like Turner. The foliage in the "Ludlow"
and "Powis" is also remarkably good.

Besides these line engravings, and to protect you from what harm there is in their influence,
you are to provide yourself, if possible, with a Rembrandt etching, or a photograph of one
(of figures, not landscape). It does not matter of what subject, or whether a sketchy or finished
one, but the sketchy ones are generally cheapest, and will teach you most. Copy it as well
as you can, noticing especially that Rembrandt's most rapid lines have steady purpose; and
that they are laid with almost inconceivable precision when the object becomes at all interesting.
The "Prodigal Son," "Death of the Virgin," "Abraham and Isaac," and such others, containing
incident and character rather than chiaroscuro, will be the most instructive. You can buy one;
copy it well; then exchange it, at little loss, for another; and so, gradually, obtain a good
knowledge of his system. Whenever you have an opportunity of examining his work at museums,
&c., do so with the greatest care, not looking at many things, but a long time at each. You
must also provide yourself, if possible, with an engraving of Albert Durer's. This you will
not be able to copy; but you must keep it beside you, and refer to it as a standard of precision
in line. If you can get one with a wing in it, it will be best. The crest with the cock, that
with the skull and satyr, and the "Melancholy," are the best you could have, but any will do.
Perfection in chiaroscuro drawing lies between these two masters, Rembrandt and Durer. Rembrandt
is often too loose and vague; and Durer has little or no effect of mist or uncertainty. If
you can see anywhere a drawing by Leonardo, you will find it balanced between the two characters;
but there are no engravings which present this perfection, and your style will be best formed,
therefore, by alternate study of Rembrandt and Durer. Lean rather to Durer; it is better for
amateurs to err on the side of precision than on that of vagueness: and though, as I have just
said, you cannot copy a Durer, yet try every now and then a quarter of an inch square or so,
and see how much nearer you can come; you cannot possibly try to draw the leafly crown of the
"Melancholia" too often.

If you cannot get either a Rembrandt or a Durer, you may still learn much by carefully studying
any of George Cruikshank's etchings, or Leech's woodcuts in Punch, on the free side; with Alfred
Rethel's and Richter's[218] on the severe side. But in so doing you will need to notice the
following points:

When either the material (as the copper or wood) or the time of an artist, does not permit
him to make a perfect drawing,--that is to say, one in which no lines shall be prominently
visible,--and he is reduced to show the black lines, either drawn by the pen, or on the wood,
it is better to make these lines help, as far as may be, the expression of texture and form.
You will thus find many textures, as of cloth or grass or flesh, and many subtle effects of
light, expressed by Leech with zigzag or crossed or curiously broken lines; and you will see
that Alfred Rethel and Richter constantly express the direction and rounding of surfaces by
the direction of the lines which shade them. All these various means of expression will be
useful to you, as far as you can learn them, provided you remember that they are merely a kind
of shorthand; telling certain facts, not in quite the right way, but in the only possible way
under the conditions: and provided in any after use of such means, you never try to show your
own dexterity; but only to get as much record of the object as you can in a given time; and
that you continually make efforts to go beyond shorthand, and draw portions of the objects rightly.

And touching this question of direction of lines as indicating that of surface, observe these
few points:

If lines are to be distinctly shown, it is better that, so far as they can indicate any thing
by their direction, they should explain rather than oppose the general character of the object.
Thus, in the piece of woodcut from Titian, Fig. 10., the lines are serviceable by expressing,
not only the shade of the trunk, but partly also its roundness, and the flow of its grain.
And Albert Durer, whose work was chiefly engraving, sets himself always thus to make his lines
as valuable as possible; telling much by them, both of shade and direction of surface: and
if you were always to be limited to engraving on copper (and did not want to express effects
of mist or darkness, as well as delicate forms), Albert Durer's way of work would be the best
example for you. But, inasmuch as the perfect way of drawing is by shade without lines, and
the great painters always conceive their subject as complete, even when they are sketching
it most rapidly, you will find that, when they are not limited in means, they do not much trust
to direction of line, but will often scratch in the shade of a rounded surface with nearly
straight lines, that is to say, with the easiest and quickest lines possible to themselves.
When the hand is free, the easiest line for it to draw is one inclining from the left upward
to the right, or vice versâ, from the right downwards to the left; and when done very quickly,
the line is hooked a little at the end by the effort at return to the next. Hence, you will
always find the pencil, chalk, or pen sketch of a very great master full of these kind of lines;
and even if he draws carefully, you will find him using simple straight lines from left to
right, when an inferior master will have used curved ones. Fig. 11. is a fair facsimile of
part of a sketch of Raphael's, which exhibits these characters very distinctly. Even the careful
drawings of Leonardo da Vinci are shaded most commonly with straight lines; and you may always
assume it as a point increasing the probability of a drawing being by a great master if you
find rounded surfaces, such as those of cheeks or lips, shaded with straight lines.

But you will also now understand how easy it must be for dishonest dealers to forge or imitate
scrawled sketches like Figure 11., and pass them for the work of great masters; and how the
power of determining the genuineness of a drawing depends entirely on your knowing the facts
of the object drawn, and perceiving whether the hasty handling is all conducive to the expression
of those truths. In a great man's work, at its fastest, no line is thrown away, and it is not
by the rapidity, but the economy of the execution that you know him to be great. Now to judge
of this economy, you must know exactly what he meant to do, otherwise you cannot of course
discern how far he has done it; that is, you must know the beauty and nature of the thing he
was drawing. All judgment of art thus finally founds itself on knowledge of Nature.

But farther observe, that this scrawled, or economic, or impetuous execution is never affectedly
impetuous. If a great man is not in a hurry, he never pretends to be; if he has no eagerness
in his heart, he puts none into his hand; if he thinks his effect would be better got with
two lines, he never, to show his dexterity, tries to do it with one. Be assured, therefore
(and this is a matter of great importance), that you will never produce a great drawing by
imitating the execution of a great master. Acquire his knowledge and share his feelings, and
the easy execution will fall from your hand as it did from his; but if you merely scrawl because
he scrawled, or blot because he blotted, you will not only never advance in power, but every
able draughtsman, and every judge whose opinion is worth having, will know you for a cheat,
and despise you accordingly.

Again, observe respecting the use of outline:

All merely outlined drawings are bad, for the simple reason, that an artist of any power can
always do more, and tell more, by quitting his outlines occasionally, and scratching in a few
lines for shade, than he can by restricting himself to outline only. Hence the fact of his
so restricting himself, whatever may be the occasion, shows him to be a bad draughtsman, and
not to know how to apply his power economically. This hard law, however, bears only on drawings
meant to remain in the state in which you see them; not on those which were meant to be proceeded
with, or for some mechanical use. It is sometimes necessary to draw pure outlines, as an incipient
arrangement of a composition, to be filled up afterwards with colour, or to be pricked through
and used as patterns or tracings; but if, with no such ultimate object, making the drawing
wholly for its own sake, and meaning it to remain in the state he leaves it, an artist restricts
himself to outline, he is a bad draughtsman, and his work is bad. There is no exception to
this law. A good artist habitually sees masses, not edges, and can in every case make his drawing
more expressive (with any given quantity of work) by rapid shade than by contours; so that
all good work whatever is more or less touched with shade, and more or less interrupted as outline.

Hence, the published works of Retsch, and all the English imitations of them, and all outline
engravings from pictures, are bad work, and only serve to corrupt the public taste, and of
such outlines, the worst are those which are darkened in some part of their course by way of
expressing the dark side, as Flaxman's from Dante, and such others; because an outline can
only be true so long as it accurately represents the form of the given object with one of its
edges. Thus, the outline a and the outline b, Fig. 12., are both true outlines of a ball; because,
however thick the line may be, whether we take the interior or exterior edge of it, that edge
of it always draws a true circle. But c is a false outline of a ball, because either the inner
or outer edge of the black line must be an untrue circle, else the line could not be thicker
in one place than another. Hence all "force," as it is called, is gained by falsification of
the contours; so that no artist whose eye is true and fine could endure to look at it. It does
indeed often happen that a painter, sketching rapidly, and trying again and again for some
line which he cannot quite strike, blackens or loads the first line by setting others beside
and across it; and then a careless observer supposes it has been thickened on purpose; or,
sometimes also, at a place where shade is afterwards to enclose the form, the painter will
strike a broad dash of this shade beside his outline at once, looking as if he meant to thicken
the outline; whereas this broad line is only the first instalment of the future shadow, and
the outline is really drawn with its inner edge. And thus, far from good draughtsmen darkening
the lines which turn away from the light, the tendency with them is rather to darken them towards
the light, for it is there in general that shade will ultimately enclose them. The best example
of this treatment that I know is Raphael's sketch, in the Louvre, of the head of the angel
pursuing Heliodorus, the one that shows part of the left eye; where the dark strong lines which
terminate the nose and forehead towards the light are opposed to tender and light ones behind
the ear, and in other places towards the shade. You will see in Fig. 11. the same principle
variously exemplified; the principal dark lines, in the head and drapery of the arms, being
on the side turned to the light.

All these refinements and ultimate principles, however, do not affect your drawing for the
present. You must try to make your outlines as equal as possible; and employ pure outline only
for the two following purposes: either (1.) to steady your hand, as in Exercise II., for if
you cannot draw the line itself, you will never be able to terminate your shadow in the precise
shape required, when the line is absent; or (2.) to give you shorthand memoranda of forms,
when you are pressed for time. Thus the forms of distant trees in groups are defined, for the
most part, by the light edge of the rounded mass of the nearer one being shown against the
darker part of the rounded mass of a more distant one; and to draw this properly, nearly as
much work is required to round each tree as to round the stone in Fig. 5. Of course you cannot
often get time to do this; but if you mark the terminal line of each tree as is done by Durer
in Fig. 13., you will get a most useful memorandum of their arrangement, and a very interesting
drawing. Only observe in doing this, you must not, because the procedure is a quick one, hurry
that procedure itself. You will find, on copying that bit of Durer, that every one of his lines
is firm, deliberate, and accurately descriptive as far as it goes. It means a bush of such
a size and such a shape, definitely observed and set down; it contains a true "signalement"
of every nut-tree, and apple-tree, and higher bit of hedge, all round that village. If you
have not time to draw thus carefully, do not draw at all--you are merely wasting your work
and spoiling your taste. When you have had four or five years' practice you may be able to
make useful memoranda at a rapid rate, but not yet; except sometimes of light and shade, in
a way of which I will tell you presently. And this use of outline, note farther, is wholly
confined to objects which have edges or limits. You can outline line a tree or a stone, when
it rises against another tree or stone; but you cannot outline folds in drapery, or waves in
water; if these are to be expressed at all it must be by some sort of shade, and therefore
the rule that no good drawing can consist throughout of pure outline remains absolute. You
see, in that woodcut of Durer's, his reason for even limiting himself so much to outline as
he has, in those distant woods and plains, is that he may leave them in bright light, to be
thrown out still more by the dark sky and the dark village spire; and the scene becomes real
and sunny only by the addition of these shades.

Understanding, then, thus much of the use of outline, we will go back to our question about
tree drawing left unanswered at page 60.

We were, you remember, in pursuit of mystery among the leaves. Now, it is quite easy to obtain
mystery and disorder, to any extent; but the difficulty is to keep organisation in the midst
of mystery. And you will never succeed in doing this unless you lean always to the definite
side, and allow yourself rarely to become quite vague, at least through all your early practice.
So, after your single groups of leaves, your first step must be to conditions like Figs. 14.
and 15., which are careful facsimiles of two portions of a beautiful woodcut of Durer's, the
Flight into Egypt. Copy these carefully,--never mind how little at a time, but thoroughly;
then trace the Durer, and apply it to your drawing, and do not be content till the one fits
the other, else your eye is not true enough to carry you safely through meshes of real leaves.
And in the course of doing this, you will find that not a line nor dot of Durer's can be displaced
without harm; that all add to the effect, and either express something, or illumine something,
or relieve something. If, afterwards, you copy any of the pieces of modern tree drawing, of
which so many rich examples are given constantly in our cheap illustrated periodicals (any
of the Christmas numbers of last year's Illustrated News or Times are full of them), you will
see that, though good and forcible general effect is produced, the lines are thrown in by thousands
without special intention, and might just as well go one way as another, so only that there
be enough of them to produce all together a well-shaped effect of intricacy: and you will find
that a little careless scratching about with your pen will bring you very near the same result
without an effort; but that no scratching of pen, nor any fortunate chance, nor anything but
downright skill and thought, will imitate so much as one leaf of Durer's. Yet there is considerable
intricacy and glittering confusion in the interstices of those vine leaves of his, as well
as of the grass.

When you have got familiarised to this firm manner, you may draw from Nature as much as you
like in the same way, and when you are tired of the intense care required for this, you may
fall into a little more easy massing of the leaves, as in Fig. 10. p. 66. This is facsimiled
from an engraving after Titian, but an engraving not quite first-rate in manner, the leaves
being a little too formal; still, it is a good enough model for your times of rest; and when
you cannot carry the thing even so far as this, you may sketch the forms of the masses, as
in Fig. 16.,[219] taking care always to have thorough command over your hand; that is, not
to let the mass take a free shape because your hand ran glibly over the paper, but because
in nature it has actually a free and noble shape, and you have faithfully followed the same.

And now that we have come to questions of noble shape, as well as true shape, and that we are
going to draw from nature at our pleasure, other considerations enter into the business, which
are by no means confined to first practice, but extend to all practice; these (as this letter
is long enough, I should think, to satisfy even the most exacting of correspondents) I will
arrange in a second letter; praying you only to excuse the tiresomeness of this first one--tiresomeness
inseparable from directions touching the beginning of any art,--and to believe me, even though
I am trying to set you to dull and hard work.

    Very faithfully yours,
    J. RUSKIN.

FOOTNOTES:

[199] (N. B. This note is only for the satisfaction of incredulous or curious readers. You
may miss it if you are in a hurry, or are willing to take the statement in the text on trust.)

The perception of solid Form is entirely a matter of experience. We see nothing but flat colours;
and it is only by a series of experiments that we find out that a stain of black or grey indicates
the dark side of a solid substance, or that a faint hue indicates that the object in which
it appears is far away. The whole technical power of painting depends on our recovery of what
may be called the innocence of the eye; that is to say, a sort of childish perception of these
flat stains of colour, merely as such, without consciousness of what they signify, as a blind
man would see them if suddenly gifted with sight.

For instance; when grass is lighted strongly by the sun in certain directions, it is turned
from green into a peculiar and somewhat dusty-looking yellow. If we had been born blind, and
were suddenly endowed with sight on a piece of grass thus lighted in some parts by the sun,
it would appear to us that part of the grass was green, and part a dusty yellow (very nearly
of the colour of primroses); and, if there were primroses near, we should think that the sunlighted
grass was another mass of plants of the same sulphur-yellow colour. We should try to gather
some of them, and then find that the colour went away from the grass when we stood between
it and the sun, but not from the primroses; and by a series of experiments we should find out
that the sun was really the cause of the colour in the one,--not in the other. We go through
such processes of experiment unconsciously in childhood; and having once come to conclusions
touching the signification of certain colours, we always suppose that we see what we only know,
and have hardly any consciousness of the real aspect of the signs we have learned to interpret.
Very few people have any idea that sunlighted grass is yellow.

Now, a highly accomplished artist has always reduced himself as nearly as possible to this
condition of infantine sight. He sees the colours of nature exactly as they are, and therefore
perceives at once in the sunlighted grass the precise relation between the two colours that
form its shade and light. To him it does not seem shade and light, but bluish green barred
with gold.

Strive, therefore, first of all, to convince yourself of this great fact about sight. This,
in your hand, which you know by experience and touch to be a book, is to your eye nothing but
a patch of white, variously gradated and spotted; this other thing near you, which by experience
you know to be a table, is to your eye only a patch of brown, variously darkened and veined;
and so on: and the whole art of Painting consists merely in perceiving the shape and depth
of these patches of colour, and putting patches of the same size, depth, and shape on canvas.
The only obstacle to the success of painting is, that many of the real colours are brighter
and paler than it is possible to put on canvas: we must put darker ones to represent them.

[200] Stale crumb of bread is better, if you are making a delicate drawing, than India-rubber,
for it disturbs the surface of the paper less: but it crumbles about the room and makes a mess;
and, besides, you waste the good bread, which is wrong; and your drawing will not for a long
while be worth the crumbs. So use India-rubber very lightly; or, if heavily pressing it only,
not passing it over the paper, and leave what pencil marks that will not come away so, without
minding them. In a finished drawing the uneffaced penciling is often serviceable, helping the
general tone, and enabling you to take out little bright lights.

[201] What is usually so much sought after under the term "freedom" is the character of the
drawing of a great master in a hurry, whose hand is so thoroughly disciplined, that when pressed
for time he can let it fly as it will, and it will not go far wrong. But the hand of a great
master at real work is never free: its swiftest dash is under perfect government. Paul Veronese
or Tintoret could pause within a hair's breadth of any appointed mark, in their fastest touches;
and follow, within a hair's breadth, the previously intended curve. You must never, therefore,
aim at freedom. It is not required of your drawing that it should be free, but that it should
be right: in time you will be able to do right easily, and then your work will be free in the
best sense; but there is no merit in doing wrong easily.

These remarks, however, do not apply to the lines used in shading, which, it will be remembered,
are to be made as quickly as possible. The reason of this is, that the quicker a line is drawn,
the lighter it is at the ends, and therefore the more easily joined with other lines, and concealed
by them; the object in perfect shading being to conceal the lines as much as possible.

And observe, in this exercise, the object is more to get firmness of hand than accuracy of
eye for outline; for there are no outlines in Nature, and the ordinary student is sure to draw
them falsely if he draws them at all. Do not, therefore, be discouraged if you find mistakes
continue to occur in your outlines; be content at present if you find your hand gaining command
over the curves.

[202] If you can get any pieces of dead white porcelain, not glazed, they will be useful models.

[203] Artists who glance at this book may be surprised at this permission. My chief reason
is, that I think it more necessary that the pupil's eye should be trained to accurate perception
of the relations of curve and right lines, by having the latter absolutely true, than that
he should practice drawing straight lines. But also, I believe, though I am not quite sure
of this, that he never ought to be able to draw a straight line. I do not believe a perfectly
trained hand ever can draw a line without some curvature in it, or some variety of direction.
Prout could draw a straight line, but I do not believe Raphael could, nor Tintoret. A great
draughtsman can, as far as I have observed, draw every line but a straight one.

[204] Or, if you feel able to do so, scratch them in with confused quick touches, indicating
the general shape of the cloud or mist of twigs round the main branches; but do not take much
trouble about them.

[205] It is more difficult, at first, to get, in colour, a narrow gradation than an extended
one; but the ultimate difficulty is, as with the pen, to make the gradation go far.

[206] Of course, all the columns of colour are to be of equal length.

[207] The degree of darkness you can reach with the given colour is always indicated by the
colour of the solid cake in the box.

[208] The figure a, Fig. 5., is very dark, but this is to give an example of all kinds of depth
of tint, without repeated figures.

[209] Nearly neutral in ordinary circumstances, but yet with quite different tones in its neutrality,
according to the colours of the various reflected rays that compose it.

[210] If we had any business with the reasons of this, I might, perhaps, be able to show you
some metaphysical ones for the enjoyment, by truly artistical minds, of the changes wrought
by light, and shade, and perspective in patterned surfaces; but this is at present not to the
point; and all that you need to know is that the drawing of such things is good exercise, and
moreover a kind of exercise which Titian, Veronese, Tintoret, Giorgione, and Turner, all enjoyed,
and strove to excel in.

[211] The use of acquiring this habit of execution is that you may be able, when you begin
to colour, to let one hue be seen in minute portions, gleaming between the touches of another.

[212] William Hunt, of the Old Water-colour Society.

[213] At Marlborough House, among the four principal examples of Turner's later water-colour
drawing, perhaps the most neglected is that of fishing-boats and fish at sunset. It is one
of his most wonderful works, though unfinished. If you examine the larger white fishing-boat
sail, you will find it has a little spark of pure white in its right-hand upper corner, about
as large as a minute pin's head, and that all the surface of the sail is gradated to that focus.
Try to copy this sail once or twice, and you will begin to understand Turner's work. Similarly,
the wing of the Cupid in Correggio's large picture in the National Gallery is focussed to two
little grains of white at the top of it. The points of light on the white flower in the wreath
round the head of the dancing child-faun, in Titian's Bacchus and Ariadne, exemplify the same
thing.

[214] I shall not henceforward number the exercises recommended; as they are distinguished
only by increasing difficulty of subject, not by difference of method.

[215] If you understand the principle of the stereoscope you will know why; if not, it does
not matter; trust me for the truth of the statement, as I cannot explain the principle without
diagrams and much loss of time.

[216] If you can, get first the plates marked with a star. The letters mean as follows:--

    a stands for architecture, including distant grouping of towns,
    cottages, &c.
    c clouds, including mist and aërial effects.

LETTER II.

SKETCHING FROM NATURE.

MY DEAR READER:--

The work we have already gone through together has, I hope, enabled you to draw with fair success,
either rounded and simple masses, like stones, or complicated arrangements of form, like those
of leaves; provided only these masses or complexities will stay quiet for you to copy, and
do not extend into quantity so great as to baffle your patience. But if we are now to go out
to the fields, and to draw anything like a complete landscape, neither of these conditions
will any more be observed for us. The clouds will not wait while we copy their heaps or clefts;
the shadows will escape from us as we try to shape them, each, in its stealthy minute march,
still leaving light where its tremulous edge had rested the moment before, and involving in
eclipse objects that had seemed safe from its influence; and instead of the small clusters
of leaves which we could reckon point by point, embarrassing enough even though numerable,
we have now leaves as little to be counted as the sands of the sea, and restless, perhaps,
as its foam.

In all that we have to do now, therefore, direct imitation becomes more or less impossible.
It is always to be aimed at so far as it is possible; and when you have time and opportunity,
some portions of a landscape may, as you gain greater skill, be rendered with an approximation
almost to mirrored portraiture. Still, whatever skill you may reach, there will always be need
of judgment to choose, and of speed to seize, certain things that are principal or fugitive;
and you must give more and more effort daily to the observance of characteristic points, and
the attainment of concise methods.

I have directed your attention early to foliage for two reasons. First, that it is always accessible
as a study; and secondly, that its modes of growth present simple examples of the importance
of leading or governing lines. It is by seizing these leading lines, when we cannot seize all,
that likeness and expression are given to a portrait, and grace and a kind of vital truth to
the rendering of every natural form. I call it vital truth, because these chief lines are always
expressive of the past history and present action of the thing. They show in a mountain, first,
how it was built or heaped up; and secondly, how it is now being worn away, and from what quarter
the wildest storms strike it. In a tree, they show what kind of fortune it has had to endure
from its childhood; how troublesome trees have come in its way, and pushed it aside, and tried
to strangle or starve it; where and when kind trees have sheltered it, and grown up lovingly
together with it, bending as it bent; what winds torment it most; what boughs of it behave
best, and bear most fruit; and so on. In a wave or cloud, these leading lines show the run
of the tide and of the wind, and the sort of change which the water or vapour is at any moment
enduring in its form, as it meets shore, or counterwave, or melting sunshine. Now remember,
nothing distinguishes great men from inferior men more than their always, whether in life or
in art, knowing the way things are going. Your dunce thinks they are standing still, and draws
them all fixed; your wise man sees the change or changing in them, and draws them so--the animal
in its motion, the tree in its growth, the cloud in its course, the mountain in its wearing
away. Try always, whenever you look at a form, to see the lines in it which have had power
over its past fate, and will have power over its futurity. Those are its awful lines; see that
you seize on those, whatever else you miss. Thus, the leafage in Fig. 16. (p. 291.) grew round
the root of a stone pine, on the brow of a crag at Sestri, near Genoa, and all the sprays of
it are thrust away in their first budding by the great rude root, and spring out in every direction
round it, as water splashes when a heavy stone is thrown into it. Then, when they have got
clear of the root, they begin to bend up again; some of them, being little stone pines themselves,
have a great notion of growing upright, if they can; and this struggle of theirs to recover
their straight road towards the sky, after being obliged to grow sideways in their early years,
is the effort that will mainly influence their future destiny, and determine if they are to
be crabbed, forky pines, striking from that rock of Sestri, whose clefts nourish them, with
bared red lightning of angry arms towards the sea; or if they are to be goodly and solemn pines,
with trunks like pillars of temples, and the purple burning of their branches sheathed in deep
globes of cloudy green. Those, then, are their fateful lines; see that you give that spring
and resilience, whatever you leave ungiven: depend upon it, their chief beauty is in these.

So in trees in general and bushes, large or small, you will notice that, though the boughs
spring irregularly and at various angles, there is a tendency in all to stoop less and less
as they near the top of the tree. This structure, typified in the simplest possible terms at
c, Fig. 17., is common to all trees, that I know of, and it gives them a certain plumy character,
and aspect of unity in the hearts of their branches, which are essential to their beauty. The
stem does not merely send off a wild branch here and there to take its own way, but all the
branches share in one great fountain-like impulse; each has a curve and a path to take which
fills a definite place, and each terminates all its minor branches at its outer extremity,
so as to form a great outer curve, whose character and proportion are peculiar for each species;
that is to say, the general type or idea of a tree is not as a, Fig. 17., but as b, in which,
observe, the boughs all carry their minor divisions right out to the bounding curve; not but
that smaller branches, by thousands, terminate in the heart of the tree, but the idea and main
purpose in every branch are to carry all its child branches well out to the air and light,
and let each of them, however small, take its part in filling the united flow of the bounding
curve, so that the type of each separate bough is again not a but b, Fig. 18.; approximating,
that is to say, so far to the structure of a plant of broccoli as to throw the great mass of
spray and leafage out to a rounded surface; therefore, beware of getting into a careless habit
of drawing boughs with successive sweeps of the pen or brush, one hanging to the other, as
in Fig. 19. If you look at the tree-boughs in any painting of Wilson's, you will see this structure,
and nearly every other that is to be avoided, in their intensest types. You will also notice
that Wilson never conceives a tree as a round mass, but flat, as if it had been pressed and
dried. Most people, in drawing pines, seem to fancy, in the same way, that the boughs come
out only on two sides of the trunk, instead of all round it; always, therefore, take more pains
in trying to draw the boughs of trees that grow towards you, than those that go off to the
sides; anybody can draw the latter, but the foreshortened ones are not so easy. It will help
you in drawing them to observe that in most trees the ramification of each branch, though not
of the tree itself, is more or less flattened, and approximates, in its position, to the look
of a hand held out to receive something, or shelter something. If you take a looking-glass,
and hold your hand before it slightly hollowed, with the palm upwards, and the fingers open,
as if you were going to support the base of some great bowl, larger than you could easily hold,
and sketch your hand as you see it in the glass, with the points of the fingers towards you,
it will materially help you in understanding the way trees generally hold out their hands;
and if then you will turn yours with its palm downwards, as if you were going to try to hide
something, but with the fingers expanded, you will get a good type of the action of the lower
boughs in cedars and such other spreading trees.

Fig. 20. will give you a good idea of the simplest way in which these and other such facts
can be rapidly expressed; if you copy it carefully, you will be surprised to find how the touches
all group together, in expressing the plumy toss of the tree branches, and the springing of
the bushes out of the bank, and the undulation of the ground: note the careful drawing of the
footsteps made by the climbers of the little mound on the left.[220] It is facsimiled from
an etching of Turner's, and is as good an example as you can have of the use of pure and firm
lines; it will also show you how the particular action in foliage, or anything else to which
you wish to direct attention, may be intensified by the adjuncts. The tall and upright trees
are made to look more tall and upright still, because their line is continued below by the
figure of the farmer with his stick; and the rounded bushes on the bank are made to look more
rounded because their line is continued in one broad sweep by the black dog and the boy climbing
the wall. These figures are placed entirely with this object, as we shall see more fully hereafter
when we come to talk about composition; but, if you please, we will not talk about that yet
awhile. What I have been telling you about the beautiful lines and action of foliage has nothing
to do with composition, but only with fact, and the brief and expressive representation of
fact. But there will be no harm in your looking forward, if you like to do so, to the account,
in Letter III. of the "Law of Radiation," and reading what it said there about tree growth:
indeed it would in some respects have been better to have said it here than there, only it
would have broken up the account of the principles of composition somewhat awkwardly.

Now, although the lines indicative of action are not always quite so manifest in other things
as in trees, a little attention will soon enable you to see that there are such lines in everything.
In an old house roof, a bad observer and bad draughtsman will only see and draw the spotty
irregularity of tiles or slates all over; but a good draughtsman will see all the bends of
the under timbers, where they are weakest and the weight is telling on them most, and the tracks
of the run of the water in time of rain, where it runs off fastest, and where it lies long
and feeds the moss; and he will be careful, however few slates he draws, to mark the way they
bend together towards those hollows (which have the future fate of the roof in them), and crowd
gradually together at the top of the gable, partly diminishing in perspective, partly, perhaps,
diminished on purpose (they are so in most English old houses) by the slate-layer. So in ground,
there is always the direction of the run of the water to be noticed, which rounds the earth
and cuts it into hollows; and, generally, in any bank, or height worth drawing, a trace of
bedded or other internal structure besides. The figure 20. will give you some idea of the way
in which such facts may be expressed by a few lines. Do you not feel the depression in the
ground all down the hill where the footsteps are, and how the people always turn to the left
at the top, losing breath a little, and then how the water runs down in that other hollow towards
the valley, behind the roots of the trees?

Now, I want you in your first sketches from nature to aim exclusively at understanding and
representing these vital facts of form; using the pen--not now the steel, but the quill--firmly
and steadily, never scrawling with it, but saying to yourself before you lay on a single touch,--"That
leaf is the main one, that bough is the guiding one, and this touch, so long, so broad, means
that part of it,"--point or side or knot, as the case may be. Resolve always, as you look at
the thing, what you will take, and what miss of it, and never let your hand run away with you,
or get into any habit or method of touch. If you want a continuous line, your hand should pass
calmly from one end of it to the other, without a tremor; if you want a shaking and broken
line, your hand should shake, or break off, as easily as a musician's finger shakes or stops
on a note: only remember this, that there is no general way of doing any thing; no recipe can
be given you for so much as the drawing of a cluster of grass. The grass may be ragged and
stiff, or tender and flowing; sunburnt and sheep-bitten, or rank and languid; fresh or dry;
lustrous or dull: look at it, and try to draw it as it is, and don't think how somebody "told
you to do grass." So a stone may be round and angular, polished or rough, cracked all over
like an ill-glazed teacup, or as united and broad as the breast of Hercules. It may be as flaky
as a wafer, as powdery as a field puff-ball; it may be knotted like a ship's hawser, or kneaded
like hammered iron, or knit like a Damascus sabre, or fused like a glass bottle, or crystallised
like a hoar-frost, or veined like a forest leaf: look at it, and don't try to remember how
anybody told you to "do a stone."

As soon as you find that your hand obeys you thoroughly and that you can render any form with
a firmness and truth approaching that of Turner's and Durer's work,[221] you must add a simple
but equally careful light and shade to your pen drawing, so as to make each study as complete
as possible: for which you must prepare yourself thus. Get, if you have the means, a good impression
of one plate of Turner's Liber Studiorum; if possible, one of the subjects named in the note
below.[222]

If you cannot obtain, or even borrow for a little while, any of these engravings, you must
use a photograph instead (how, I will tell you presently); but, if you can get the Turner,
it will be best. You will see that it is composed of a firm etching in line, with mezzotint
shadow laid over it. You must first copy the etched part of it accurately; to which end put
the print against the window, and trace slowly with the greatest care every black line; retrace
this on smooth drawing-paper; and, finally, go over the whole with your pen, looking at the
original plate always, so that if you err at all, it may be on the right side, not making a
line which is too curved or too straight already in the tracing, more curved or more straight,
as you go over it. And in doing this, never work after you are tired, nor to "get the thing
done," for if it is badly done, it will be of no use to you. The true zeal and patience of
a quarter of an hour are better than the sulky and inattentive labour of a whole day. If you
have not made the touches right at the first going over with the pen, retouch them delicately,
with little ink in your pen, thickening or reinforcing them as they need: you cannot give too
much care to the facsimile. Then keep this etched outline by you, in order to study at your
ease the way in which Turner uses his line as preparatory for the subsequent shadow;[223] it
is only in getting the two separate that you will be able to reason on this. Next, copy once
more, though for the fourth time, any part of this etching which you like, and put on the light
and shade with the brush, and any brown colour that matches that of the plate;[224] working
it with the point of the brush as delicately as if you were drawing with pencil, and dotting
and cross-hatching as lightly as you can touch the paper, till you get the gradations of Turner's
engraving. In this exercise, as in the former one, a quarter of an inch worked to close resemblance
of the copy is worth more than the whole subject carelessly done. Not that in drawing afterwards
from nature, you are to be obliged to finish every gradation in this way, but that, once having
fully accomplished the drawing something rightly, you will thenceforward feel and aim at a
higher perfection than you could otherwise have conceived, and the brush will obey you, and
bring out quickly and clearly the loveliest results, with a submissiveness which it would have
wholly refused if you had not put it to severest work. Nothing is more strange in art than
the way that chance and materials seem to favour you, when once you have thoroughly conquered
them. Make yourself quite independent of chance, get your result in spite of it, and from that
day forward all things will somehow fall as you would have them. Show the camel's-hair, and
the colour in it, that no bending nor blotting are of any use to escape your will; that the
touch and the shade shall finally be right, if it cost you a year's toil; and from that hour
of corrective conviction, said camel's-hair will bend itself to all your wishes, and no blot
will dare to transgress its appointed border. If you cannot obtain a print from the Liber Studiorum,
get a photograph[225] of some general landscape subject, with high hills and a village, or
picturesque town, in the middle distance, and some calm water of varied character (a stream
with stones in it, if possible), and copy any part of it you like, in this same brown colour,
working, as I have just directed you to do from the Liber, a great deal with the point of the
brush. You are under a twofold disadvantage here, however; first, there are portions in every
photograph too delicately done for you at present to be at all able to copy; and secondly,
there are portions always more obscure or dark than there would be in the real scene, and involved
in a mystery which you will not be able, as yet, to decipher. Both these characters will be
advantageous to you for future study, after you have gained experience, but they are a little
against you in early attempts at tinting; still you must fight through the difficulty, and
get the power of producing delicate gradations with brown or grey, like those of the photograph.

Now observe; the perfection of work would be tinted shadow, like photography, without any obscurity
or exaggerated darkness; and as long as your effect depends in anywise on visible lines, your
art is not perfect, though it may be first-rate of its kind. But to get complete results in
tints merely, requires both long time and consummate skill; and you will find that a few well-put
pen lines, with a tint dashed over or under them, get more expression of facts than you could
reach in any other way, by the same expenditure of time. The use of the Liber Studiorum print
to you is chiefly as an example of the simplest shorthand of this kind, a shorthand which is
yet capable of dealing with the most subtle natural effects; for the firm etching gets at the
expression of complicated details, as leaves, masonry, textures of ground, &c., while the overlaid
tint enables you to express the most tender distances of sky, and forms of playing light, mist
or cloud. Most of the best drawings by the old masters are executed on this principle, the
touches of the pen being useful also to give a look of transparency to shadows, which could
not otherwise be attained but by great finish of tinting; and if you have access to any ordinarily
good public gallery, or can make friends of any print-sellers who have folios of old drawings,
or facsimiles of them, you will not be at a loss to find some example of this unity of pen
with tinting. Multitudes of photographs also are now taken from the best drawings by the old
masters, and I hope that our Mechanics' Institutes, and other societies organized with a view
to public instruction, will not fail to possess themselves of examples of these, and to make
them accessible to students of drawing in the vicinity; a single print from Turner's Liber,
to show the unison of tint with pen etching, and the "St. Catherine," lately photographed by
Thurston Thompson, from Raphael's drawing in the Louvre, to show the unity of the soft tinting
of the stump with chalk, would be all that is necessary, and would, I believe, be in many cases
more serviceable than a larger collection, and certainly than a whole gallery of second-rate
prints. Two such examples are peculiarly desirable, because all other modes of drawing, with
pen separately, or chalk separately, or colour separately, may be seen by the poorest student
in any cheap illustrated book, or in shop windows. But this unity of tinting with line he cannot
generally see but by some especial enquiry, and in some out of the way places he could not
find a single example of it. Supposing that this should be so in your own case, and that you
cannot meet with any example of this kind, try to make the matter out alone, thus:

Take a small and simple photograph; allow yourself half an hour to express its subjects with
the pen only, using some permanent liquid colour instead of ink, outlining its buildings or
trees firmly, and laying in the deeper shadows, as you have been accustomed to do in your bolder
pen drawings; then, when this etching is dry, take your sepia or grey, and tint it over, getting
now the finer gradations of the photograph; and finally, taking out the higher lights with
penknife or blotting-paper. You will soon find what can be done in this way; and by a series
of experiments you may ascertain for yourself how far the pen may be made serviceable to reinforce
shadows, mark characters of texture, outline unintelligible masses, and so on. The more time
you have, the more delicate you may make the pen drawing, blending it with the tint; the less
you have, the more distinct you must keep the two. Practice in this way from one photograph,
allowing yourself sometimes only a quarter of an hour for the whole thing, sometimes an hour,
sometimes two or three hours; in each case drawing the whole subject in full depth of light
and shade, but with such degree of finish in the parts as is possible in the given time. And
this exercise, observe, you will do well to repeat frequently whether you can get prints and
drawings as well as photographs, or not.

And now at last, when you can copy a piece of Liber Studiorum, or its photographic substitute,
faithfully, you have the complete means in your power of working from nature on all subjects
that interest you, which you should do in four different ways.

First. When you have full time, and your subject is one that will stay quiet for you, make
perfect light and shade studies, or as nearly perfect as you can, with grey or brown colour
of any kind, reinforced and defined with the pen.

Secondly. When your time is short, or the subject is so rich in detail that you feel you cannot
complete it intelligibly in light and shade, make a hasty study of the effect, and give the
rest of the time to a Dureresque expression of the details. If the subject seems to you interesting,
and there are points about it which you cannot understand, try to get five spare minutes to
go close up to it, and make a nearer memorandum; not that you are ever to bring the details
of this nearer sketch into the farther one, but that you may thus perfect your experience of
the aspect of things, and know that such and such a look of a tower or cottage at five hundred
yards off means that sort of tower or cottage near; while, also, this nearer sketch will be
useful to prevent any future misinterpretation of your own work. If you have time, however
far your light and shade study in the distance may have been carried, it is always well, for
these reasons, to make also your Dureresque and your near memoranda; for if your light and
shade drawing be good, much of the interesting detail must be lost in it, or disguised.

Your hasty study of effect may be made most easily and quickly with a soft pencil, dashed over
when done with one tolerably deep tone of grey, which will fix the pencil. While this fixing
colour is wet, take out the higher lights with the dry brush; and, when it is quite dry, scratch
out the highest lights with the penknife. Five minutes, carefully applied, will do much by
these means. Of course the paper is to be white. I do not like studies on grey paper so well;
for you can get more gradation by the taking off your wet tint, and laying it on cunningly
a little darker here and there, than you can with body-colour white, unless you are consummately
skilful. There is no objection to your making your Dureresque memoranda on grey or yellow paper,
and touching or relieving them with white; only, do not depend much on your white touches,
nor make the sketch for their sake.

Thirdly. When you have neither time for careful study nor for Dureresque detail, sketch the
outline with pencil, then dash in the shadows with the brush boldly, trying to do as much as
you possibly can at once, and to get a habit of expedition and decision; laying more colour
again and again into the tints as they dry, using every expedient which your practice has suggested
to you of carrying out your chiaroscuro in the manageable and moist material, taking the colour
off here with the dry brush, scratching out lights in it there with the wooden handle of the
brush, rubbing it in with your fingers, drying it off with your sponge, &c. Then, when the
colour is in, take your pen and mark the outline characters vigorously, in the manner of the
Liber Studiorum. This kind of study is very convenient for carrying away pieces of effect which
depend not so much on refinement as on complexity, strange shapes of involved shadows, sudden
effects of sky, &c.; and it is most useful as a safeguard against any too servile or slow habits
which the minute copying may induce in you; for although the endeavour to obtain velocity merely
for velocity's sake, and dash for display's sake, is as baneful as it is despicable; there
are a velocity and a dash which not only are compatible with perfect drawing, but obtain certain
results which cannot be had otherwise. And it is perfectly safe for you to study occasionally
for speed and decision, while your continual course of practice is such as to ensure your retaining
an accurate judgment and a tender touch. Speed, under such circumstances, is rather fatiguing
than tempting; and you will find yourself always beguiled rather into elaboration than negligence.

Fourthly. You will find it of great use, whatever kind of landscape scenery you are passing
through, to get into the habit of making memoranda of the shapes of shadows. You will find
that many objects of no essential interest in themselves, and neither deserving a finished
study, nor a Dureresque one, may yet become of singular value in consequence of the fantastic
shapes of their shadows; for it happens often, in distant effect, that the shadow is by much
a more important element than the substance. Thus, in the Alpine bridge, Fig. 21., seen within
a few yards of it, as in the figure, the arrangement of timbers to which the shadows are owing
is perceptible; but at half a mile's distance, in bright sunlight, the timbers would not be
seen; and a good painter's expression of the bridge would be merely the large spot, and the
crossed bars, of pure grey; wholly without indication of their cause, as in Fig. 22. a; and
if we saw it at still greater distances, it would appear, as in Fig. 22. b and c, diminishing
at last to a strange, unintelligible, spider-like spot of grey on the light hill-side. A perfectly
great painter, throughout his distances, continually reduces his objects to these shadow abstracts;
and the singular, and to many persons unaccountable, effect of the confused touches in Turner's
distances, is owing chiefly to this thorough accuracy and intense meaning of the shadow abstracts.

Studies of this kind are easily made when you are in haste, with an F. or HB. pencil: it requires
some hardness of the point to ensure your drawing delicately enough when the forms of the shadows
are very subtle; they are sure to be so somewhere, and are generally so everywhere. The pencil
is indeed a very precious instrument after you are master of the pen and brush, for the pencil,
cunningly used, is both, and will draw a line with the precision of the one and the gradation
of the other; nevertheless, it is so unsatisfactory to see the sharp touches, on which the
best of the detail depends, getting gradually deadened by time, or to find the places where
force was wanted look shiny, and like a fire-grate, that I should recommend rather the steady
use of the pen, or brush, and colour, whenever time admits of it; keeping only a small memorandum-book
in the breast-pocket, with its well-cut, sheathed pencil, ready for notes on passing opportunities:
but never being without this.

Thus much, then, respecting the manner in which you are at first to draw from nature. But it
may perhaps be serviceable to you, if I also note one or two points respecting your choice
of subjects for study, and the best special methods of treating some of them; for one of by
no means the least difficulties which you have at first to encounter is a peculiar instinct,
common, as far as I have noticed, to all beginners, to fix on exactly the most unmanageable
feature in the given scene. There are many things in every landscape which can be drawn, if
at all, only by the most accomplished artists; and I have noticed that it is nearly always
these which a beginner will dash at; or, if not these, it will be something which, though pleasing
to him in itself, is unfit for a picture, and in which, when he has drawn it, he will have
little pleasure. As some slight protection against this evil genius of beginners, the following
general warnings may be useful:

1. Do not draw things that you love, on account of their associations; or at least do not draw
them because you love them; but merely when you cannot get anything else to draw. If you try
to draw places that you love, you are sure to be always entangled amongst neat brick walls,
iron railings, gravel walks, greenhouses, and quickset hedges; besides that you will be continually
led into some endeavour to make your drawing pretty, or complete, which will be fatal to your
progress. You need never hope to get on, if you are the least anxious that the drawing you
are actually at work upon should look nice when it is done. All you have to care about is to
make it right, and to learn as much in doing it as possible. So then, though when you are sitting
in your friend's parlour, or in your own, and have nothing else to do, you may draw any thing
that is there, for practice; even the fire-irons or the pattern on the carpet: be sure that
it is for practice, and not because it is a beloved carpet, nor a friendly poker and tongs,
nor because you wish to please your friend by drawing her room.

Also, never make presents of your drawings. Of course I am addressing you as a beginner--a
time may come when your work will be precious to everybody; but be resolute not to give it
away till you know that it is worth something (as soon as it is worth anything you will know
that it is so). If any one asks you for a present of a drawing, send them a couple of cakes
of colour and a piece of Bristol board: those materials are, for the present, of more value
in that form than if you had spread the one over the other.

The main reason for this rule is, however, that its observance will much protect you from the
great danger of trying to make your drawings pretty.

2. Never, by choice, draw anything polished; especially if complicated in form. Avoid all brass
rods and curtain ornaments, chandeliers, plate, glass, and fine steel. A shining knob of a
piece of furniture does not matter if it comes in your way; but do not fret yourself if it
will not look right, and choose only things that do not shine.

3. Avoid all very neat things. They are exceedingly difficult to draw, and very ugly when drawn.
Choose rough, worn, and clumsy-looking things as much as possible; for instance, you cannot
have a more difficult or profitless study than a newly-painted Thames wherry, nor a better
study than an old empty coal-barge, lying ashore at low-tide: in general, everything that you
think very ugly will be good for you to draw.

4. Avoid, as much as possible, studies in which one thing is seen through another. You will
constantly find a thin tree standing before your chosen cottage, or between you and the turn
of the river; its near branches all entangled with the distance. It is intensely difficult
to represent this; and though, when the tree is there, you must not imaginarily cut it down,
but do it as well as you can, yet always look for subjects that fall into definite masses,
not into network; that is, rather for a cottage with a dark tree beside it, than for one with
a thin tree in front of it; rather for a mass of wood, soft, blue, and rounded, than for a
ragged copse, or confusion of intricate stems.

5. Avoid, as far as possible, country divided by hedges. Perhaps nothing in the whole compass
of landscape is so utterly unpicturesque and unmanageable as the ordinary English patchwork
of field and hedge, with trees dotted over it in independent spots, gnawed straight at the
cattle line.

Still, do not be discouraged if you find you have chosen ill, and that the subject overmasters
you. It is much better that it should, than that you should think you had entirely mastered
it. But at first, and even for some time, you must be prepared for very discomfortable failure;
which, nevertheless, will not be without some wholesome result.

As, however, I have told you what most definitely to avoid, I may, perhaps, help you a little
by saying what to seek. In general, all banks are beautiful things, and will reward work better
than large landscapes. If you live in a lowland country, you must look for places where the
ground is broken to the river's edges, with decayed posts, or roots of trees; or, if by great
good luck there should be such things within your reach, for remnants of stone quays or steps,
mossy mill-dams, &c. Nearly every other mile of road in chalk country will present beautiful
bits of broken bank at its sides; better in form and colour than high chalk cliffs. In woods,
one or two trunks, with the flowery ground below, are at once the richest and easiest kind
of study: a not very thick trunk, say nine inches or a foot in diameter, with ivy running up
it sparingly, is an easy, and always a rewarding subject.

Large nests of buildings in the middle distance are always beautiful, when drawn carefully,
provided they are not modern rows of pattern cottages; or villas with Ionic and Doric porticos.
Any old English village, or cluster of farm-houses, drawn with all its ins and outs, and haystacks,
and palings, is sure to be lovely; much more a French one. French landscape is generally as
much superior to English as Swiss landscape is to French; in some respects, the French is incomparable.
Such scenes as that avenue on the Seine, which I have recommended you to buy the engraving
of, admit no rivalship in their expression of graceful rusticity and cheerful peace, and in
the beauty of component lines.

In drawing villages, take great pains with the gardens; a rustic garden is in every way beautiful.
If you have time, draw all the rows of cabbages, and hollyhocks, and broken fences, and wandering
eglantines, and bossy roses: you cannot have better practice, nor be kept by anything in purer
thoughts.

Make intimate friends of all the brooks in your neighbourhood, and study them ripple by ripple.

Village churches in England are not often good subjects; there is a peculiar meanness about
most of them, and awkwardness of line. Old manor-houses are often pretty. Ruins are usually,
with us, too prim, and cathedrals too orderly. I do not think there is a single cathedral in
England from which it is possible to obtain one subject for an impressive drawing. There is
always some discordant civility, or jarring vergerism about them.

If you live in a mountain or hill country, your only danger is redundance of subject. Be resolved,
in the first place, to draw a piece of rounded rock, with its variegated lichens, quite rightly,
getting its complete roundings, and all the patterns of the lichen in true local colour. Till
you can do this, it is of no use your thinking of sketching among hills; but when once you
have done this, the forms of distant hills will be comparatively easy.

When you have practised for a little time from such of these subjects as may be accessible
to you, you will certainly find difficulties arising which will make you wish more than ever
for a master's help: these difficulties will vary according to the character of your own mind
(one question occurring to one person, and one to another), so that it is impossible to anticipate
them all; and it would make this too large a book if I answered all that I can anticipate;
you must be content to work on, in good hope that nature will, in her own time, interpret to
you much for herself; that farther experience on your own part will make some difficulties
disappear; and that others will be removed by the occasional observation of such artists' work
as may come in your way. Nevertheless, I will not close this letter without a few general remarks,
such as may be useful to you after you are somewhat advanced in power; and these remarks may,
I think, be conveniently arranged under three heads, having reference to the drawing of vegetation,
water, and skies.

And, first, of vegetation. You may think, perhaps, we have said enough about trees already;
yet if you have done as you were bid, and tried to draw them frequently enough, and carefully
enough, you will be ready by this time to hear a little more of them. You will also recollect
that we left our question, respecting the mode of expressing intricacy of leafage, partly unsettled
in the first letter. I left it so because I wanted you to learn the real structure of leaves,
by drawing them for yourself, before I troubled you with the most subtle considerations as
to method in drawing them. And by this time, I imagine, you must have found out two principal
things, universal facts, about leaves; namely, that they always, in the main tendencies of
their lines, indicate a beautiful divergence of growth, according to the law of radiation,
already referred to;[226] and the second, that this divergence is never formal, but carried
out with endless variety of individual line. I must now press both these facts on your attention
a little farther.

You may perhaps have been surprised that I have not yet spoken of the works of J. D. Harding,
especially if you happen to have met with the passages referring to them in "Modern Painters,"
in which they are highly praised. They are deservedly praised, for they are the only works
by a modern draughtsman which express in any wise the energy of trees, and the laws of growth,
of which we have been speaking. There are no lithographic sketches which, for truth of general
character, obtained with little cost of time, at all rival Harding's. Calame, Robert, and the
other lithographic landscape sketchers are altogether inferior in power, though sometimes a
little deeper in meaning. But you must not take even Harding for a model, though you may use
his works for occasional reference; and if you can afford to buy his "Lessons on Trees,"[227]
it will be serviceable to you in various ways, and will at present help me to explain the point
under consideration. And it is well that I should illustrate this point by reference to Harding's
works, because their great influence on young students renders it desirable that their real
character should be thoroughly understood.

You will find, first, in the title-page of the "Lessons on Trees," a pretty woodcut, in which
the tree stems are drawn with great truth, and in a very interesting arrangement of lines.
Plate 1. is not quite worthy of Mr. Harding, tending too much to make his pupil, at starting,
think everything depends on black dots; still the main lines are good, and very characteristic
of tree growth. Then, in Plate 2., we come to the point at issue. The first examples in that
plate are given to the pupil that he may practise from them till his hand gets into the habit
of arranging lines freely in a similar manner; and they are stated by Mr. Harding to be universal
in application; "all outlines expressive of foliage," he says, "are but modifications of them."
They consist of groups of lines, more or less resembling our Fig. 23.; and the characters especially
insisted upon are, that they "tend at their inner ends to a common centre;" that "their ends
terminate in [are enclosed by] ovoid curves;" and that "the outer ends are most emphatic."

Now, as thus expressive of the great laws of radiation and enclosure, the main principle of
this method of execution confirms, in a very interesting way, our conclusions respecting foliage
composition. The reason of the last rule, that the outer end of the line is to be most emphatic,
does not indeed at first appear; for the line at one end of a natural leaf is not more emphatic
than the line at the other: but ultimately, in Harding's method, this darker part of the touch
stands more or less for the shade at the outer extremity of the leaf mass; and, as Harding
uses these touches, they express as much of tree character as any mere habit of touch can express.
But, unfortunately, there is another law of tree growth, quite as fixed as the law of radiation,
which this and all other conventional modes of execution wholly lose sight of. This second
law is, that the radiating tendency shall be carried out only as a ruling spirit in reconcilement
with perpetual individual caprice on the part of the separate leaves. So that the moment a
touch is monotonous, it must be also false, the liberty of the leaf individually being just
as essential a truth, as its unity of growth with its companions in the radiating group.

It does not matter how small or apparently symmetrical the cluster may be, nor how large or
vague. You can hardly have a more formal one than b in Fig. 9. p. 276., nor a less formal one
than this shoot of Spanish chestnut, shedding its leaves, Fig. 24.; but in either of them,
even the general reader, unpractised in any of the previously recommended exercises, must see
that there are wandering lines mixed with the radiating ones, and radiating lines with the
wild ones: and if he takes the pen and tries to copy either of these examples, he will find
that neither play of hand to left nor to right, neither a free touch nor a firm touch, nor
any learnable or describable touch whatsoever, will enable him to produce, currently, a resemblance
of it; but that he must either draw it slowly, or give it up. And (which makes the matter worse
still) though gathering the bough, and putting it close to you, or seeing a piece of near foliage
against the sky, you may draw the entire outline of the leaves, yet if the spray has light
upon it, and is ever so little a way off, you will miss, as we have seen, a point of a leaf
here, and an edge there; some of the surfaces will be confused by glitter, and some spotted
with shade; and if you look carefully through this confusion for the edges or dark stems which
you really can see, and put only those down, the result will be neither like Fig. 9. nor Fig.
24., but such an interrupted and puzzling piece of work as Fig. 25.[228]

Now, it is in the perfect acknowledgment and expression of these three laws that all good drawing
of landscape consists. There is, first, the organic unity; the law, whether of radiation, or
parallelism, or concurrent action, which rules the masses of herbs and trees, of rocks, and
clouds, and waves; secondly, the individual liberty of the members subjected to these laws
of unity; and, lastly, the mystery under which the separate character of each is more or less
concealed.

I say, first, there must be observance of the ruling organic law. This is the first distinction
between good artists and bad artists. Your common sketcher or bad painter puts his leaves on
the trees as if they were moss tied to sticks; he cannot see the lines of action or growth;
he scatters the shapeless clouds over his sky, not perceiving the sweeps of associated curves
which the real clouds are following as they fly; and he breaks his mountain side into rugged
fragments, wholly unconscious of the lines of force with which the real rocks have risen, or
of the lines of couch in which they repose. On the contrary, it is the main delight of the
great draughtsman to trace these laws of government; and his tendency to error is always in
the exaggeration of their authority rather than in its denial.

Secondly, I say, we have to show the individual character and liberty of the separate leaves,
clouds, or rocks. And herein the great masters separate themselves finally from the inferior
ones; for if the men of inferior genius ever express law at all, it is by the sacrifice of
individuality. Thus, Salvator Rosa has great perception of the sweep of foliage and rolling
of clouds, but never draws a single leaflet or mist wreath accurately. Similarly, Gainsborough,
in his landscape, has great feeling for masses of form and harmony of colour; but in the detail
gives nothing but meaningless touches; not even so much as the species of tree, much less the
variety of its leafage, being ever discernable. Now, although both these expressions of government
and individuality are essential to masterly work, the individuality is the more essential,
and the more difficult of attainment; and, therefore, that attainment separates the great masters
finally from the inferior ones. It is the more essential, because, in these matters of beautiful
arrangement in visible things, the same rules hold that hold in moral things. It is a lamentable
and unnatural thing to see a number of men subject to no government, actuated by no ruling
principle, and associated by no common affection: but it would be a more lamentable thing still,
were it possible to see a number of men so oppressed into assimilation as to have no more any
individual hope or character, no differences in aim, no dissimilarities of passion, no irregularities
of judgment; a society in which no man could help another, since none would be feebler than
himself; no man admire another, since none would be stronger than himself; no man be grateful
to another, since by none he could be relieved; no man reverence another, since by none he
could be instructed; a society in which every soul would be as the syllable of a stammerer
instead of the word of a speaker, in which every man would walk as in a frightful dream, seeing
spectres of himself, in everlasting multiplication, gliding helplessly around him in a speechless
darkness. Therefore it is that perpetual difference, play, and change in groups of form are
more essential to them even than their being subdued by some great gathering law: the law is
needful to them for their perfection and their power, but the difference is needful to them
for their life.

And here it may be noted in passing, that if you enjoy the pursuit of analogies and types,
and have any ingenuity of judgment in discerning them, you may always accurately ascertain
what are the noble characters in a piece of painting, by merely considering what are the noble
characters of man in his association with his fellows. What grace of manner and refinement
of habit are in society, grace of line and refinement of form are in the association of visible
objects. What advantage or harm there may be in sharpness, ruggedness, or quaintness in the
dealings or conversations of men; precisely that relative degree of advantage or harm there
is in them as elements of pictorial composition. What power is in liberty or relaxation to
strengthen or relieve human souls; that power, precisely in the same relative degree, play
and laxity of line have to strengthen or refresh the expression of a picture. And what goodness
or greatness we can conceive to arise in companies of men, from chastity of thought, regularity
of life, simplicity of custom, and balance of authority; precisely that kind of goodness and
greatness may be given to a picture by the purity of its colour, the severity of its forms,
and the symmetry of its masses.

You need not be in the least afraid of pushing these analogies too far. They cannot be pushed
too far; they are so precise and complete, that the farther you pursue them, the clearer, the
more certain, the more useful you will find them. They will not fail you in one particular,
or in any direction of enquiry. There is no moral vice, no moral virtue, which has not its
precise prototype in the art of painting; so that you may at your will illustrate the moral
habit by the art, or the art by the moral habit. Affection and discord, fretfulness and quietness,
feebleness and firmness, luxury and purity, pride and modesty, and all other such habits, and
every conceivable modification and mingling of them, may be illustrated, with mathematical
exactness, by conditions of line and colour; and not merely these definable vices and virtues,
but also every conceivable shade of human character and passion, from the righteous or unrighteous
majesty of the king, to the innocent or faultful simplicity of the shepherd boy.

The pursuit of this subject belongs properly, however, to the investigation of the higher branches
of composition, matters which it would be quite useless to treat of in this book; and I only
allude to them here, in order that you may understand how the utmost nobleness of art are concerned
in this minute work, to which I have set you in your beginning of it. For it is only by the
closest attention, and the most noble execution, that it is possible to express these varieties
of individual character, on which all excellence of portraiture depends, whether of masses
of mankind, or of groups of leaves.

Now you will be able to understand, among other matters, wherein consists the excellence, and
wherein the shortcoming, of the tree-drawing of Harding. It is excellent in so far as it fondly
observes, with more truth than any other work of the kind, the great laws of growth and action
in trees: it fails--and observe, not in a minor, but in a principal point--because it cannot
rightly render any one individual detail or incident of foliage. And in this it fails, not
from mere carelessness or incompletion, but of necessity; the true drawing of detail being
for evermore impossible to a hand which has contracted a habit of execution. The noble draughtsman
draws a leaf, and stops, and says calmly--That leaf is of such and such a character; I will
give him a friend who will entirely suit him: then he considers what his friend ought to be,
and having determined, he draws his friend. This process may be as quick as lightning when
the master is great--one of the sons of the giants; or it may be slow and timid: but the process
is always gone through, no touch or form is ever added to another by a good painter without
a mental determination and affirmation. But when the hand has got into a habit, leaf No. 1.
necessitates leaf No. 2.; you cannot stop, your hand is as a horse with the bit in its teeth;
or rather is, for the time, a machine, throwing out leaves to order and pattern, all alike.
You must stop that hand of yours, however painfully; make it understand that it is not to have
its own way any more, that it shall never more slip from, one touch to another without orders;
otherwise it is not you who are the master, but your fingers. You may therefore study Harding's
drawing, and take pleasure in it;[229] and you may properly admire the dexterity which applies
the habit of the hand so well, and produces results on the whole so satisfactory: but you must
never copy it, otherwise your progress will be at once arrested. The utmost you can ever hope
to do, would be a sketch in Harding's manner, but of far inferior dexterity; for he has given
his life's toil to gain his dexterity, and you, I suppose, have other things to work at besides
drawing. You would also incapacitate yourself from ever understanding what truly great work
was, or what Nature was; but by the earnest and complete study of facts, you will gradually
come to understand the one and love the other more and more, whether you can draw well yourself
or not.

I have yet to say a few words respecting the third law above stated, that of mystery; the law,
namely, that nothing is ever seen perfectly, but only by fragments, and under various conditions
of obscurity.[230] This last fact renders the visible objects of Nature complete as a type
of the human nature. We have, observe, first, Subordination; secondly, Individuality; lastly,
and this not the least essential character, Incomprehensibility; a perpetual lesson in every
serrated point and shining vein which escape or deceive our sight among the forest leaves,
how little we may hope to discern clearly, or judge justly, the rents and veins of the human
heart; how much of all that is round us, in men's actions or spirits, which we at first think
we understand, a closer and more loving watchfulness would show to be full of mystery, never
to be either fathomed or withdrawn.

The expression of this final character in landscape has never been completely reached by any
except Turner; nor can you hope to reach it at all until you have given much time to the practice
of art. Only try always when you are sketching any object with a view to completion in light
and shade, to draw only those parts of it which you really see definitely; preparing for the
after development of the forms by chiaroscuro. It is this preparation by isolated touches for
a future arrangement of superimposed light and shade which renders the etchings of the Liber
Studiorum so inestimable as examples and so peculiar. The character exists more or less in
them exactly in proportion to the pains that Turner has taken. Thus the Æsacus and Hespérie
was wrought out with the greatest possible care; and the principal branch on the near tree
is etched as in Fig. 26. The work looks at first like a scholar's instead of a master's; but
when the light and shade are added, every touch falls into its place, and a perfect expression
of grace and complexity results. Nay even before the light and shade are added, you ought to
be able to see that these irregular and broken lines, especially where the expression is given
of the way the stem loses itself in the leaves, are more true than the monotonous though graceful
leaf-drawing which, before Turner's time, had been employed, even by the best masters, in their
distant masses. Fig. 27. is sufficiently characteristic of the manner of the old woodcuts after
Titian; in which, you see, the leaves are too much of one shape, like bunches of fruit; and
the boughs too completely seen, besides being somewhat soft and leathery in aspect, owing to
the want of angles in their outline. By great men like Titian, this somewhat conventional structure
was only given in haste to distant masses; and their exquisite delineation of the foreground,
kept their conventionalism from degeneracy: but in the drawing of the Caracci and other derivative
masters, the conventionalism prevails everywhere, and sinks gradually into scrawled work, like
Fig. 28., about the worst which it is possible to get into the habit of using, though an ignorant
person might perhaps suppose it more "free," and therefore better than Fig. 26. Note, also,
that in noble outline drawing, it does not follow that a bough is wrongly drawn, because it
looks contracted unnaturally somewhere, as in Fig. 26., just above the foliage. Very often
the muscular action which is to be expressed by the line, runs into the middle of the branch,
and the actual outline of the branch at that place may be dimly seen, or not at all; and it
is then only by the future shade that its actual shape, or the cause of its disappearance,
will be indicated.

One point more remains to be noted about trees, and I have done. In the minds of our ordinary
water-colour artists, a distant tree seems only to be conceived as a flat green blot, grouping
pleasantly with other masses, and giving cool colour to the landscape, but differing nowise,
in texture, from the blots of other shapes, which these painters use to express stones, or
water, or figures. But as soon as you have drawn trees carefully a little while, you will be
impressed, and impressed more strongly the better you draw them, with the idea of their softness
of surface. A distant tree is not a flat and even piece of colour, but a more or less globular
mass of a downy or bloomy texture, partly passing into a misty vagueness. I find, practically,
this lovely softness of far-away trees the most difficult of all characters to reach, because
it cannot be got by mere scratching or roughening the surface, but is always associated with
such delicate expressions of form and growth as are only imitable by very careful drawing.
The penknife passed lightly over this careful drawing, will do a good deal; but you must accustom
yourself, from the beginning, to aim much at this softness in the lines of the drawing itself,
by crossing them delicately, and more or less effacing and confusing the edges. You must invent,
according to the character of tree, various modes of execution adapted to express its texture;
but always keep this character of softness in your mind and in your scope of aim; for in most
landscapes it is the intention of nature that the tenderness and transparent infinitude of
her foliage should be felt, even at the far distance, in the most distinct opposition to the
solid masses and flat surfaces of rocks or buildings.

       *       *       *       *       *

II. We were, in the second place, to consider a little the modes of representing water, of
which important feature of landscape I have hardly said anything yet.

Water is expressed, in common drawings, by conventional lines, whose horizontality is supposed
to convey the idea of its surface. In paintings, white dashes or bars of light are used for
the same purpose.

But these and all other such expedients are vain and absurd. A piece of calm water always contains
a picture in itself, an exquisite reflection of the objects above it. If you give the time
necessary to draw these reflections, disturbing them here and there as you see the breeze or
current disturb them, you will get the effect of the water; but if you have not patience to
draw the reflections, no expedient will give you a true effect. The picture in the pool needs
nearly as much delicate drawing as the picture above the pool; except only that if there be
the least motion on the water, the horizontal lines of the images will be diffused and broken,
while the vertical ones will remain decisive, and the oblique ones decisive in proportion to
their steepness.

A few close studies will soon teach you this: the only thing you need to be told is to watch
carefully the lines of disturbance on the surface, as when a bird swims across it, or a fish
rises, or the current plays round a stone, reed, or other obstacle. Take the greatest pains
to get the curves of these lines true; the whole value of your careful drawing of the reflections
may be lost by your admitting a single false curve of ripple from a wild duck's breast. And
(as in other subjects) if you are dissatisfied with your result, always try for more unity
and delicacy: if your reflections are only soft and gradated enough, they are nearly sure to
give you a pleasant effect. When you are taking pains, work the softer reflections, where they
are drawn out by motion in the water, with touches as nearly horizontal as may be; but when
you are in a hurry, indicate the place and play of the images with vertical lines. The actual
construction of a calm elongated reflection is with horizontal lines: but it is often impossible
to draw the descending shades delicately enough with a horizontal touch; and it is best always
when you are in a hurry, and sometimes when you are not, to use the vertical touch. When the
ripples are large, the reflections become shaken, and must be drawn with bold undulatory descending
lines.

I need not, I should think, tell you that it is of the greatest possible importance to draw
the curves of the shore rightly. Their perspective is, if not more subtle, at least more stringent
than that of any other lines in Nature. It will not be detected by the general observer, if
you miss the curve of a branch, or the sweep of a cloud, or the perspective of a building;[231]
but every intelligent spectator will feel the difference between a rightly drawn bend of shore
or shingle, and a false one. Absolutely right, in difficult river perspectives seen from heights,
I believe no one but Turner ever has been yet; and observe, there is NO rule for them. To develope
the curve mathematically would require a knowledge of the exact quantity of water in the river,
the shape of its bed, and the hardness of the rock or shore; and even with these data, the
problem would be one which no mathematician could solve but approximatively. The instinct of
the eye can do it; nothing else.

If, after a little study from Nature, you get puzzled by the great differences between the
aspect of the reflected image and that of the object casting it; and if you wish to know the
law of reflection, it is simply this: Suppose all the objects above the water actually reversed
(not in appearance, but in fact) beneath the water, and precisely the same in form and in relative
position, only all topsy-turvy. Then, whatever you can see, from the place in which you stand,
of the solid objects so reversed under the water, you will see in the reflection, always in
the true perspective of the solid objects so reversed.

If you cannot quite understand this in looking at water, take a mirror, lay it horizontally
on the table, put some books and papers upon it, and draw them and their reflections; moving
them about, and watching how their reflections alter, and chiefly how their reflected colours
and shades differ from their own colours and shades, by being brought into other oppositions.
This difference in chiaroscuro is a more important character in water painting than mere difference
in form.

When you are drawing shallow or muddy water, you will see shadows on the bottom, or on the
surface, continually modifying the reflections; and in a clear mountain stream, the most wonderful
complications of effect resulting from the shadows and reflections of the stones in it, mingling
with the aspect of the stones themselves seen through the water. Do not be frightened at the
complexity; but, on the other hand, do not hope to render it hastily. Look at it well, making
out everything that you see, and distinguishing each component part of the effect. There will
be, first, the stones seen through the water, distorted always by refraction, so that if the
general structure of the stone shows straight parallel lines above the water, you may be sure
they will be bent where they enter it; then the reflection of the part of the stone above the
water crosses and interferes with the part that is seen through it, so that you can hardly
tell which is which; and wherever the reflection is darkest, you will see through the water
best, and vice versâ. Then the real shadow of the stone crosses both these images, and where
that shadow falls, it makes the water more reflective, and where the sunshine falls, you will
see more of the surface of the water, and of any dust or motes that may be floating on it:
but whether you are to see, at the same spot, most of the bottom of the water, or of the reflection
of the objects above, depends on the position of the eye. The more you look down into the water,
the better you see objects through it; the more you look along it, the eye being low, the more
you see the reflection of objects above it. Hence the colour of a given space of surface in
a stream will entirely change while you stand still in the same spot, merely as you stoop or
raise your head; and thus the colours with which water is painted are an indication of the
position of the spectator, and connected inseparably with the perspective of the shores. The
most beautiful of all results that I know in mountain streams is when the water is shallow,
and the stones at the bottom are rich reddish-orange and black, and the water is seen at an
angle which exactly divides the visible colours between those of the stones and that of the
sky, and the sky is of clear, full blue. The resulting purple obtained by the blending of the
blue and the orange-red, broken by the play of innumerable gradations in the stones, is indescribably
lovely.

All this seems complicated enough already; but if there be a strong colour in the clear water
itself, as of green or blue in the Swiss lakes, all these phenomena are doubly involved; for
the darker reflections now become of the colour of the water. The reflection of a black gondola,
for instance, at Venice, is never black, but pure dark green. And, farther, the colour of the
water itself is of three kinds: one, seen on the surface, is a kind of milky bloom; the next
is seen where the waves let light through them, at their edges; and the third, shown as a change
of colour on the objects seen through the water. Thus, the same wave that makes a white object
look of a clear blue, when seen through it, will take a red or violet-coloured bloom on its
surface, and will be made pure emerald green by transmitted sunshine through its edges. With
all this, however, you are not much concerned at present, but I tell it you partly as a preparation
for what we have afterwards to say about colour, and partly that you may approach lakes and
streams with reverence, and study them as carefully as other things, not hoping to express
them by a few horizontal dashes of white, or a few tremulous blots.[232] Not but that much
may be done by tremulous blots, when you know precisely what you mean by them, as you will
see by many of the Turner sketches, which are now framed at the National Gallery; but you must
have painted water many and many a day--yes, and all day long--before you can hope to do anything
like those.

       *       *       *       *       *

III. Lastly. You may perhaps wonder why, before passing to the clouds, I say nothing special
about ground.[233] But there is too much to be said about that to admit of my saying it here.
You will find the principal laws of its structure examined at length in the fourth volume of
"Modern Painters;" and if you can get that volume, and copy carefully Plate 21., which I have
etched after Turner with great pains, it will give you as much help as you need in the linear
expression of ground-surface. Strive to get the retirement and succession of masses in irregular
ground: much may be done in this way by careful watching of the perspective diminutions of
its herbage, as well as by contour; and much also by shadows. If you draw the shadows of leaves
and tree trunks on any undulating ground with entire carefulness, you will be surprised to
find how much they explain of the form and distance of the earth on which they fall.

Passing then to skies, note that there is this great peculiarity about sky subject, as distinguished
from earth subject;--that the clouds, not being much liable to man's interference, are always
beautifully arranged. You cannot be sure of this in any other features of landscape. The rock
on which the effect of a mountain scene especially depends is always precisely that which the
roadmaker blasts or the landlord quarries; and the spot of green which Nature left with a special
purpose by her dark forest sides, and finished with her most delicate grasses, is always that
which the farmer ploughs or builds upon. But the clouds, though we can hide them with smoke,
and mix them with poison, cannot be quarried nor built over, and they are always therefore
gloriously arranged; so gloriously, that unless you have notable powers of memory you need
not hope to approach the effect of any sky that interests you. For both its grace and its glow
depend upon the united influence of every cloud within its compass: they all move and burn
together in a marvellous harmony; not a cloud of them is out of its appointed place, or fails
of its part in the choir: and if you are not able to recollect (which in the case of a complicated
sky it is impossible you should) precisely the form and position of all the clouds at a given
moment, you cannot draw the sky at all; for the clouds will not fit if you draw one part of
them three or four minutes before another. You must try therefore to help what memory you have,
by sketching at the utmost possible speed the whole range of the clouds; marking, by any shorthand
or symbolic work you can hit upon, the peculiar character of each, as transparent, or fleecy,
or linear, or undulatory; giving afterwards such completion to the parts as your recollection
will enable you to do. This, however, only when the sky is interesting from its general aspect;
at other times, do not try to draw all the sky, but a single cloud: sometimes a round cumulus
will stay five or six minutes quite steady enough to let you mark out his principal masses:
and one or two white or crimson lines which cross the sunrise will often stay without serious
change for as long. And in order to be the readier in drawing them, practise occasionally drawing
lumps of cotton, which will teach you better than any other stable thing the kind of softness
there is in clouds. For you will find when you have made a few genuine studies of sky, and
then look at any ancient or modern painting, that ordinary artists have always fallen into
one of two faults: either, in rounding the clouds, they make them as solid and hard-edged as
a heap of stones tied up in a sack, or they represent them not as rounded at all, but as vague
wreaths of mist or flat lights in the sky; and think they have done enough in leaving a little
white paper between dashes of blue, or in taking an irregular space out with the sponge. Now
clouds are not as solid as flour-sacks; but, on the other hand, they are neither spongy nor
flat. They are definite and very beautiful forms of sculptured mist; sculptured is a perfectly
accurate word; they are not more drifted into form than they are carved into form, the warm
air around them cutting them into shape by absorbing the visible vapour beyond certain limits;
hence their angular and fantastic outlines, as different from a swollen, spherical, or globular
formation, on the one hand, as from that of flat films or shapeless mists on the other. And
the worst of all is, that while these forms are difficult enough to draw on any terms, especially
considering that they never stay quiet, they must be drawn also at greater disadvantage of
light and shade than any others, the force of light in clouds being wholly unattainable by
art; so that if we put shade enough to express their form as positively as it is expressed
in reality, we must make them painfully too dark on the dark sides. Nevertheless, they are
so beautiful, if you in the least succeed with them, that you will hardly, I think, lose courage.
Outline them often with the pen, as you can catch them here and there; one of the chief uses
of doing this will be, not so much the memorandum so obtained as the lesson you will get respecting
the softness of the cloud-outlines. You will always find yourself at a loss to see where the
outline really is; and when drawn it will always look hard and false, and will assuredly be
either too round or too square, however often you alter it, merely passing from the one fault
to the other and back again, the real cloud striking an inexpressible mean between roundness
and squareness in all its coils or battlements. I speak at present, of course, only of the
cumulus cloud: the lighter wreaths and flakes of the upper sky cannot be outlined--they can
only be sketched, like locks of hair, by many lines of the pen. Firmly developed bars of cloud
on the horizon are in general easy enough, and may be drawn with decision. When you have thus
accustomed yourself a little to the placing and action of clouds, try to work out their light
and shade, just as carefully as you do that of other things, looking exclusively for examples
of treatment to the vignettes in Rogers's Italy and Poems, and to the Liber Studiorum, unless
you have access to some examples of Turner's own work. No other artist ever yet drew the sky:
even Titian's clouds, and Tintoret's, are conventional. The clouds in the "Ben Arthur," "Source
of Arveron," and "Calais Pier," are among the best of Turner's storm studies; and of the upper
clouds, the vignettes to Rogers's Poems furnish as many examples as you need.

And now, as our first lesson was taken from the sky, so, for the present, let our last be.
I do not advise you to be in any haste to master the contents of my next letter. If you have
any real talent for drawing, you will take delight in the discoveries of natural loveliness,
which the studies I have already proposed will lead you into, among the fields and hills; and
be assured that the more quietly and single-heartedly you take each step in the art, the quicker,
on the whole, will your progress be. I would rather, indeed, have discussed the subjects of
the following letter at greater length, and in a separate work addressed to more advanced students;
but as there are one or two things to be said on composition which may set the young artist's
mind somewhat more at rest, or furnish him with defence from the urgency of ill-advisers, I
will glance over the main heads of the matter here; trusting that my doing so may not beguile
you, my dear reader, from your serious work, or lead you to think me, in occupying part of
this book with talk not altogether relevant to it, less entirely or

    Faithfully yours,

    J. RUSKIN.

FOOTNOTES:

[220] It is meant, I believe, for "Salt Hill."

[221] I do not mean that you can approach Turner or Durer in their strength, that is to say,
in their imagination or power of design. But you may approach them, by perseverance, in truth
of manner.

[222] The following are the most desirable plates:

    Grande Chartreuse.
    Æsacus and Hespérie.
    Cephalus and Procris.
    Source of Arveron.
    Ben Arthur.
    Watermill.
    Hindhead Hill.
    Hedging and Ditching.
    Dumblane Abbey.
    Morpeth.
    Calais Pier.
    Pembury Mill.
    Little Devil's Bridge.
    River Wye (not Wye and Severn).
    Holy Island.
    Clyde.
    Lauffenbourg.
    Blair Athol.
    Alps from Grenoble.
    Raglan. (Subject with quiet brook, trees, and castle on the right.)

If you cannot get one of these, any of the others will be serviceable, except only the twelve
following, which are quite useless:--

1. Scene in Italy, with goats on a walled road, and trees above.

2. Interior of church.

3. Scene with bridge, and trees above; figures on left, one playing a pipe.

4. Scene with figure playing on tambourine.

5. Scene on Thames with high trees, and a square tower of a church seen through them.

6. Fifth Plague of Egypt.

7. Tenth Plague of Egypt.

8. Rivaulx Abbey.

9. Wye and Severn.

10. Scene with castle in centre, cows under trees on the left.

11. Martello Towers.

12. Calm.

It is very unlikely that you should meet with one of the original etchings; if you should,
it will be a drawing-master in itself alone, for it is not only equivalent to a pen-and-ink
drawing by Turner, but to a very careful one: only observe, the Source of Arveron, Raglan,
and Dumblane were not etched by Turner; and the etchings of those three are not good for separate
study, though it is deeply interesting to see how Turner, apparently provoked at the failure
of the beginnings in the Arveron and Raglan, took the plates up himself, and either conquered
or brought into use the bad etching by his marvellous engraving. The Dumblane was, however,
well etched by Mr. Lupton, and beautifully engraved by him. The finest Turner etching is of
an aqueduct with a stork standing in a mountain stream, not in the published series; and next
to it, are the unpublished etchings of the Via Mala and Crowhurst. Turner seems to have been
so fond of these plates that he kept retouching and finishing them, and never made up his mind
to let them go. The Via Mala is certainly, in the state in which Turner left it, the finest
of the whole series: its etching is, as I said, the best after that of the aqueduct. Figure
20., above, is part of another fine unpublished etching, "Windsor, from Salt Hill." Of the
published etchings, the finest are the Ben Arthur, Æsacus, Cephalus, and Stone Pines, with
the Girl washing at a Cistern; the three latter are the more generally instructive. Hindhead
Hill, Isis, Jason, and Morpeth, are also very desirable.

[223] You will find more notice of this point in the account of Harding's tree-drawing, a little
farther on.

[224] The impressions vary so much in colour that no brown can be specified.

[225] You had better get such a photograph, even if you have a Liber print as well.

[227] Bogue, Fleet Street. If you are not acquainted with Harding's works (an unlikely supposition,
considering their popularity), and cannot meet with the one in question, the diagrams given
here will enable you to understand all that is needful for our purposes.

[228] I draw this figure (a young shoot of oak) in outline only, it being impossible to express
the refinements of shade in distant foliage in a woodcut.

[229] His lithographic sketches, those, for instance, in the Park and the Forest, and his various
lessons on foliage, possess greater merit than the more ambitious engravings in his "Principles
and Practice of Art." There are many useful remarks, however, dispersed through this latter work.

[230] On this law you will do well, if you can get access to it, to look at the fourth chapter
of the fourth volume of "Modern Painters."

[231] The student may hardly at first believe that the perspective of buildings is of little
consequence: but he will find it so ultimately. See the remarks on this point in the Preface.

[232] It is a useful piece of study to dissolve some Prussian blue in water, so as to make
the liquid definitely blue: fill a large white basin with the solution, and put anything you
like to float on it, or lie in it; walnut shells, bits of wood, leaves of flowers, &c. Then
study the effects of the reflections, and of the stems of the flowers or submerged portions
of the floating objects, as they appear through the blue liquid; noting especially how, as
you lower your head and look along the surface, you see the reflections clearly; and how, as
you raise your head, you lose the reflections, and see the submerged stems clearly.

LETTER III.

ON COLOUR AND COMPOSITION.

MY DEAR READER:--

If you have been obedient, and have hitherto done all that I have told you, I trust it has
not been without much subdued remonstrance, and some serious vexation. For I should be sorry
if, when you were led by the course of your study to observe closely such things as are beautiful
in colour, you had not longed to paint them, and felt considerable difficulty in complying
with your restriction to the use of black, or blue, or grey. You ought to love colour, and
to think nothing quite beautiful or perfect without it; and if you really do love it, for its
own sake, and are not merely desirous to colour because you think painting a finer thing than
drawing, there is some chance you may colour well. Nevertheless, you need not hope ever to
produce anything more than pleasant helps to memory, or useful and suggestive sketches in colour,
unless you mean to be wholly an artist. You may, in the time which other vocations leave at
your disposal, produce finished, beautiful, and masterly drawings in light and shade. But to
colour well, requires your life. It cannot be done cheaper. The difficulty of doing right is
increased--not twofold nor threefold, but a thousandfold, and more--by the addition of colour
to your work. For the chances are more than a thousand to one against your being right both
in form and colour with a given touch: it is difficult enough to be right in form, if you attend
to that only; but when you have to attend, at the same moment, to a much more subtle thing
than the form, the difficulty is strangely increased--and multiplied almost to infinity by
this great fact, that, while form is absolute, so that you can say at the moment you draw any
line that it is either right or wrong, colour is wholly relative. Every hue throughout your
work is altered by every touch that you add in other places; so that what was warm a minute
ago, becomes cold when you have put a hotter colour in another place, and what was in harmony
when you left it, becomes discordant as you set other colours beside it; so that every touch
must be laid, not with a view to its effect at the time, but with a view to its effect in futurity,
the result upon it of all that is afterwards to be done being previously considered. You may
easily understand that, this being so, nothing but the devotion of life, and great genius besides,
can make a colourist.

But though you cannot produce finished coloured drawings of any value, you may give yourself
much pleasure, and be of great use to other people, by occasionally sketching with a view to
colour only; and preserving distinct statements of certain colour facts--as that the harvest-moon
at rising was of such and such a red, and surrounded by clouds of such and such a rosy grey;
that the mountains at evening were in truth so deep in purple; and the waves by the boat's
side were indeed of that incredible green. This only, observe, if you have an eye for colour;
but you may presume that you have this, if you enjoy colour.

And, though of course you should always give as much form to your subject as your attention
to its colour will admit of, remember that the whole value of what you are about depends, in
a coloured sketch, on the colour merely. If the colour is wrong, everything is wrong: just
as, if you are singing, and sing false notes, it does not matter how true the words are. If
you sing at all, you must sing sweetly; and if you colour at all, you must colour rightly.
Give up all the form, rather than the slightest part of the colour: just as, if you felt yourself
in danger of a false note, you would give up the word, and sing a meaningless sound, if you
felt that so you could save the note. Never mind though your houses are all tumbling down--though
your clouds are mere blots, and your trees mere knobs, and your sun and moon like crooked sixpences--so
only that trees, clouds, houses, and sun or moon, are of the right colours. Of course, the
discipline you have gone through will enable you to hint something of form, even in the fastest
sweep of the brush; but do not let the thought of form hamper you in the least, when you begin
to make coloured memoranda. If you want the form of the subject, draw it in black and white.
If you want its colour, take its colour, and be sure you have it, and not a spurious, treacherous,
half-measured piece of mutual concession, with the colours all wrong, and the forms still anything
but right. It is best to get into the habit of considering the coloured work merely as supplementary
to your other studies; making your careful drawings of the subject first, and then a coloured
memorandum separately, as shapeless as you like, but faithful in hue, and entirely minding
its own business. This principle, however, bears chiefly on large and distant subjects; in
foregrounds and near studies, the colour cannot be had without a good deal of definition of
form. For if you do not map the mosses on the stones accurately, you will not have the right
quantity of colour in each bit of moss pattern, and then none of the colours will look right;
but it always simplifies the work much if you are clear as to your point of aim, and satisfied,
when necessary, to fail of all but that.

Now, of course, if I were to enter into detail respecting colouring, which is the beginning
and end of a painter's craft, I should need to make this a work in three volumes instead of
three letters, and to illustrate it in the costliest way. I only hope at present to set you
pleasantly and profitably to work, leaving you, within the tethering of certain leading-strings,
to gather what advantages you can from the works of art of which every year brings a greater
number within your reach;--and from the instruction which, every year, our rising artists will
be more ready to give kindly, and better able to give wisely.

And, first, of materials. Use hard cake colours, not moist colours: grind a sufficient quantity
of each on your palette every morning, keeping a separate plate, large and deep, for colours
to be used in broad washes, and wash both plate and palette every evening, so as to be able
always to get good and pure colour when you need it; and force yourself into cleanly and orderly
habits about your colours. The two best colourists of modern times, Turner and Rossetti,[234]
afford us, I am sorry to say, no confirmation of this precept by their practice. Turner was,
and Rossetti is, as slovenly in all their procedures as men can well be; but the result of
this was, with Turner, that the colours have altered in all his pictures, and in many of his
drawings; and the result of it with Rossetti is, that, though his colours are safe, he has
sometimes to throw aside work that was half done, and begin over again. William Hunt, of the
Old Water-colour, is very neat in his practice; so, I believe, is Mulready; so is John Lewis;
and so are the leading Pre-Raphaelites, Rossetti only excepted. And there can be no doubt about
the goodness of the advice, if it were only for this reason, that the more particular you are
about your colours the more you will get into a deliberate and methodical habit in using them,
and all true speed in colouring comes of this deliberation.

Use Chinese white, well ground, to mix with your colours in order to pale them, instead of
a quantity of water. You will thus be able to shape your masses more quietly, and play the
colours about with more ease; they will not damp your paper so much, and you will be able to
go on continually, and lay forms of passing cloud and other fugitive or delicately shaped lights,
otherwise unattainable except by time.

This mixing of white with the pigments, so as to render them opaque, constitutes body-colour
drawing as opposed to transparent-colour drawing and you will, perhaps, have it often said
to you that this body-colour is "illegitimate." It is just as legitimate as oil-painting, being,
so far as handling is concerned, the same process, only without its uncleanliness, its unwholesomeness,
or its inconvenience; for oil will not dry quickly, nor carry safely, nor give the same effects
of atmosphere without tenfold labour. And if you hear it said that the body-colour looks chalky
or opaque, and, as is very likely, think so yourself, be yet assured of this, that though certain
effects of glow and transparencies of gloom are not to be reached without transparent colour,
those glows and glooms are not the noblest aim of art. After many years' study of the various
results of fresco and oil painting in Italy, and of body-colour and transparent colour in England,
I am now entirely convinced that the greatest things that are to be done in art must be done
in dead colour. The habit of depending on varnish or on lucid tints transparency, makes the
painter comparatively lose sight of the nobler translucence which is obtained by breaking various
colours amidst each other: and even when, as by Correggio, exquisite play of hue is joined
with exquisite transparency, the delight in the depth almost always leads the painter into
mean and false chiaroscuro; it leads him to like dark backgrounds instead of luminous ones,[235]
and to enjoy, in general, quality of colour more than grandeur of composition, and confined
light rather than open sunshine: so that the really greatest thoughts of the greatest men have
always, so far as I remember, been reached in dead colour, and the noblest oil pictures of
Tintoret and Veronese are those which are likest frescos.

Besides all this, the fact is, that though sometimes a little chalky and coarse-looking, body-colour
is, in a sketch, infinitely liker nature than transparent colour: the bloom and mist of distance
are accurately and instantly represented by the film of opaque blue (quite accurately, I think,
by nothing else); and for ground, rocks, and buildings, the earthy and solid surface is, of
course, always truer than the most finished and carefully wrought work in transparent tints
can ever be.

Against one thing, however, I must steadily caution you. All kinds of colour are equally illegitimate,
if you think they will allow you to alter at your pleasure, or blunder at your ease. There
is no vehicle or method of colour which admits of alteration or repentance; you must be right
at once, or never; and you might as well hope to catch a rifle bullet in your hand, and put
it straight, when it was going wrong, as to recover a tint once spoiled. The secret of all
good colour in oil, water, or anything else, lies primarily in that sentence spoken to me by
Mulready: "Know what you have to do." The process may be a long one, perhaps: you may have
to ground with one colour; to touch it with fragments of a second; to crumble a third into
the interstices; a fourth into the interstices of the third; to glaze the whole with a fifth;
and to reinforce in points with a sixth: but whether you have one, or ten, or twenty processes
to go through, you must go straight through them, knowingly and foreseeingly all the way; and
if you get the thing once wrong, there is no hope for you but in washing or scraping boldly
down to the white ground, and beginning again.

The drawing in body-colour will tend to teach you all this, more than any other method, and
above all it will prevent you from falling into the pestilent habit of sponging to get texture;
a trick which has nearly ruined our modern water-colour school of art. There are sometimes
places in which a skilful artist will roughen his paper a little to get certain conditions
of dusty colour with more ease than he could otherwise; and sometimes a skilfully rased piece
of paper will, in the midst of transparent tints, answer nearly the purpose of chalky body-colour
in representing the surfaces of rocks or buildings. But artifices of this kind are always treacherous
in a tyro's hands, tempting him to trust in them; and you had better always work on white or
grey paper as smooth as silk;[236] and never disturb the surface of your colour or paper, except
finally to scratch out the very highest lights if you are using transparent colours.

I have said above that body-colour drawing will teach you the use of colour better than working
with merely transparent tints; but this is not because the process is an easier one, but because
it is a more complete one, and also because it involves some working with transparent tints
in the best way. You are not to think that because you use body-colour you may make any kind
of mess that you like, and yet get out of it. But you are to avail yourself of the characters
of your material, which enable you most nearly to imitate the processes of Nature. Thus, suppose
you have a red rocky cliff to sketch, with blue clouds floating over it. You paint your cliff
first firmly, then take your blue, mixing it to such a tint (and here is a great part of the
skill needed), that when it is laid over the red, in the thickness required for the effect
of the mist, the warm rock-colour showing through the blue cloud-colour, may bring it to exactly
the hue you want; (your upper tint, therefore, must be mixed colder than you want it;) then
you lay it on, varying it as you strike it, getting the forms of the mist at once, and, if
it be rightly done, with exquisite quality of colour, from the warm tint's showing through
and between the particles of the other. When it is dry, you may add a little colour to retouch
the edges where they want shape, or heighten the lights where they want roundness, or put another
tone over the whole; but you can take none away. If you touch or disturb the surface, or by
any untoward accident mix the under and upper colours together, all is lost irrecoverably.
Begin your drawing from the ground again if you like, or throw it into the fire if you like.
But do not waste time in trying to mend it.[237]

This discussion of the relative merits of transparent and opaque colour has, however, led us
a little beyond the point where we should have begun; we must go back to our palette, if you
please. Get a cake of each of the hard colours named in the note below[238] and try experiments
on their simple combinations, by mixing each colour with every other. If you like to do it
in an orderly way, you may prepare a squared piece of pasteboard, and put the pure colours
in columns at the top and side; the mixed tints being given at the intersections, thus (the
letters standing for colours):

        b      c      d      e      f      &c.

    a  ab     ac     ad     ae     af
    b  --     bc     bd     be     bf
    c  --     --     cd     ce     cf
    d  --     --     --     de     df
    e  --     --     --     --     ef
    &c.

This will give you some general notion of the characters of mixed tints of two colours only,
and it is better in practice to confine yourself as much as possible to these, and to get more
complicated colours, either by putting a third over the first blended tint, or by putting the
third into its interstices. Nothing but watchful practice will teach you the effects that colours
have on each other when thus put over, or beside, each other.

When you have got a little used to the principal combinations, place yourself at a window which
the sun does not shine in at, commanding some simple piece of landscape; outline this landscape
roughly; then take a piece of white cardboard, cut out a hole in it about the size of a large
pea; and supposing R is the room, a d the window, and you are sitting at a, Fig. 29., hold
this cardboard a little outside of the window, upright, and in the direction b d, parallel
a little turned to the side of the window, or so as to catch more light, as at a d, never turned
as at c d, or the paper will be dark. Then you will see the landscape, bit by bit, through
the circular hole. Match the colours of each important bit as nearly as you can, mixing your
tints with white, beside the aperture. When matched, put a touch of the same tint at the top
of your paper, writing under it: "dark tree colour," "hill colour," "field colour," as the
case may be. Then wash the tint away from beside the opening, and the cardboard will be ready
to match another piece of the landscape.[239] When you have got the colours of the principal
masses thus indicated, lay on a piece of each in your sketch in its right place, and then proceed
to complete the sketch in harmony with them, by your eye.

In the course of your early experiments, you will be much struck by two things: the first,
the inimitable brilliancy of light in sky and in sunlighted things: and the second, that among
the tints which you can imitate, those which you thought the darkest will continually turn
out to be in reality the lightest. Darkness of objects is estimated by us, under ordinary circumstances,
much more by knowledge than by sight; thus, a cedar or Scotch fir, at 200 yards off, will be
thought of darker green than an elm or oak near us; because we know by experience that the
peculiar colour they exhibit, at that distance, is the sign of darkness of foliage. But when
we try them through the cardboard, the near oak will be found, indeed, rather dark green, and
the distant cedar, perhaps, pale gray-purple. The quantity of purple and grey in Nature is,
by the way, another somewhat surprising subject of discovery.

Well, having ascertained thus your principal tints, you may proceed to fill up your sketch;
in doing which observe these following particulars:

1. Many portions of your subject appeared through the aperture in the paper brighter than the
paper, as sky, sunlighted grass, &c. Leave these portions, for the present, white; and proceed
with the parts of which you can match the tints.

2. As you tried your subject with the cardboard, you must have observed how many changes of
hue took place over small spaces. In filling up your work, try to educate your eye to perceive
these differences of hue without the help of the cardboard, and lay them deliberately, like
a mosaic-worker, as separate colours, preparing each carefully on your palatte, and laying
it as if it were a patch of coloured cloth, cut out, to be fitted neatly by its edge to the
next patch; so that the fault of your work may be, not a slurred or misty look, but a patched
bed-cover look, as if it had all been cut out with scissors. For instance, in drawing the trunk
of a birch tree, there will be probably white high lights, then a pale rosy grey round them
on the light side, then a (probably greenish) deeper grey on the dark side, varied by reflected
colours, and over all, rich black strips of bark and brown spots of moss. Lay first the rosy
grey, leaving white for the high lights and for the spots of moss, and not touching the dark
side. Then lay the grey for the dark side, fitting it well up to the rosy grey of the light,
leaving also in this darker grey the white paper in the places for the black and brown moss;
then prepare the moss colours separately for each spot, and lay each in the white place left
for it. Not one grain of white, except that purposely left for the high lights, must be visible
when the work is done, even through a magnifying-glass, so cunningly must you fit the edges
to each other. Finally, take your background colours, and put them on each side of the tree-trunk,
fitting them carefully to its edge.

Fine work you would make of this, wouldn't you, if you had not learned to draw first, and could
not now draw a good outline for the stem, much less terminate a colour mass in the outline
you wanted?

Your work will look very odd for some time, when you first begin to paint in this way, and
before you can modify it, as I shall tell you presently how; but never mind; it is of the greatest
possible importance that you should practice this separate laying on of the hues, for all good
colouring finally depends on it. It is, indeed, often necessary, and sometimes desirable, to
lay one colour and form boldly over another: thus, in laying leaves on blue sky, it is impossible
always in large pictures, or when pressed for time, to fill in the blue through the interstices
of the leaves; and the great Venetians constantly lay their blue ground first, and then, having
let it dry, strike the golden brown over it in the form of the leaf, leaving the under blue
to shine through the gold, and subdue it to the olive green they want. But in the most precious
and perfect work each leaf is inlaid, and the blue worked round it: and, whether you use one
or other mode of getting your result, it is equally necessary to be absolute and decisive in
your laying the colour. Either your ground must be laid firmly first, and then your upper colour
struck upon it in perfect form, for ever, thenceforward, unalterable; or else the two colours
must be individually put in their places, and led up to each other till they meet at their
appointed border, equally, thenceforward, unchangeable. Either process, you see, involves absolute
decision. If you once begin to slur, or change, or sketch, or try this way and that with your
colour, it is all over with it and with you. You will continually see bad copyists trying to
imitate the Venetians, by daubing their colours about, and retouching, and finishing, and softening:
when every touch and every added hue only lead them farther into chaos. There is a dog between
two children in a Veronese in the Louvre, which gives the copyist much employment. He has a
dark ground behind him, which Veronese has painted first, and then when it was dry, or nearly
so, struck the locks of the dog's white hair over it with some half-dozen curling sweeps of
his brush, right at once, and forever. Had one line or hair of them gone wrong, it would have
been wrong forever; no retouching could have mended it. The poor copyists daub in first some
background, and then some dog's hair; then retouch the background, then the hair, work for
hours at it, expecting it always to come right to-morrow--"when it is finished." They may work
for centuries at it, and they will never do it. If they can do it with Veronese's allowance
of work, half a dozen sweeps of the hand over the dark background, well; if not, they may ask
the dog himself whether it will ever come right, and get true answer from him--on Launce's
conditions: "If he say 'ay,' it will; if he say 'no,' it will; if he shake his tail and say
nothing, it will."

Whenever you lay on a mass of colour, be sure that however large it may be, or however small,
it shall be gradated. No colour exists in Nature under ordinary circumstances without gradation.
If you do not see this, it is the fault of your inexperience; you will see it in due time,
if you practise enough. But in general you may see it at once. In the birch trunk, for instance,
the rosy grey must be gradated by the roundness of the stem till it meets the shaded side;
similarly the shaded side is gradated by reflected, light. Accordingly, whether by adding water,
or white paint, or by unequal force of touch (this you will do at pleasure, according to the
texture you wish to produce), you must, in every tint you lay on, make it a little paler at
one part than another, and get an even gradation between the two depths. This is very like
laying down a formal law or recipe for you; but you will find it is merely the assertion of
a natural fact. It is not indeed physically impossible to meet with an ungradated piece of
colour, but it is so supremely improbable, that you had better get into the habit of asking
yourself invariably, when you are going to copy a tint,--not "Is that gradated?" but "Which
way is it gradated?" and at least in ninety-nine out of a hundred instances, you will be able
to answer decisively after a careful glance, though the gradation may have been so subtle that
you did not see it at first. And it does not matter how small the touch of colour may be, though
not larger than the smallest pin's head, if one part of it is not darker than the rest, it
is a bad touch; for it is not merely because the natural fact is so, that your colour should
be gradated; the preciousness and pleasantness of the colour itself depends more on this than
on any other of its qualities, for gradation is to colours just what curvature is to lines,
both being felt to be beautiful by the pure instinct of every human mind, and both, considered
as types, expressing the law of gradual change and progress in the human soul itself. What
the difference is in mere beauty between a gradated and ungradated colour, may be seen easily
by laying an even tint of rose-colour on paper, and putting a rose leaf beside it. The victorious
beauty of the rose as compared with other flowers, depends wholly on the delicacy and quantity
of its colour gradations, all other flowers being either less rich in gradation, not having
so many folds of leaf; or less tender, being patched and veined instead of flushed.

4. But observe, it is not enough in general that colour should be gradated by being made merely
paler or darker at one place than another. Generally colour changes as it diminishes, and is
not merely darker at one spot, but also purer at one spot than anywhere else. It does not in
the least follow that the darkest spot should be the purest; still less so that the lightest
should be the purest. Very often the two gradations more or less cross each other, one passing
in one direction from paleness to darkness, another in another direction from purity to dullness,
but there will almost always be both of them, however reconciled; and you must never be satisfied
with a piece of colour until you have got both: that is to say, every piece of blue that you
lay on must be quite blue only at some given spot, nor that a large spot; and must be gradated
from that into less pure blue--greyish blue, or greenish blue, or purplish blue, over all the
rest of the space it occupies. And this you must do in one of three ways: either, while the
colour is wet, mix it with the colour which is to subdue it, adding gradually a little more
and a little more; or else, when the colour is quite dry, strike a gradated touch of another
colour over it, leaving only a point of the first tint visible: or else, lay the subduing tints
on in small touches, as in the exercise of tinting the chess-board. Of each of these methods
I have something to tell you separately: but that is distinct from the subject of gradation,
which I must not quit without once more pressing upon you the preëminent necessity of introducing
it everywhere. I have profound dislike of anything like habit of hand, and yet, in this one
instance, I feel almost tempted to encourage you to get into a habit of never touching paper
with colour, without securing a gradation. You will not in Turner's largest oil pictures, perhaps
six or seven feet long by four or five high, find one spot of colour as large as a grain of
wheat ungradated: and you will find in practice, that brilliancy of hue, and vigour of light,
and even the aspect of transparency in shade, are essentially dependent on this character alone;
hardness, coldness, and opacity resulting far more from equality of colour than from nature
of colour. Give me some mud off a city crossing, some ochre out of a gravel pit, a little whitening,
and some coal-dust, and I will paint you a luminous picture, if you give me time to gradate
my mud, and subdue my dust: but though you had the red of the ruby, the blue of the gentian,
snow for the light, and amber for the gold, you cannot paint a luminous picture, if you keep
the masses of those colours unbroken in purity, and unvarying in depth.

5. Next note the three processes by which gradation and other characters are to be obtained:

A. Mixing while the colour is wet.

You may be confused by my first telling you to lay on the hues in separate patches, and then
telling you to mix hues together as you lay them on: but the separate masses are to be laid,
when colours distinctly oppose each other at a given limit; the hues to be mixed, when they
palpitate one through the other, or fade one into the other. It is better to err a little on
the distinct side. Thus I told you to paint the dark and light sides of the birch trunk separately,
though in reality, the two tints change, as the trunk turns away from the light, gradually
one into the other: and, after being laid separately on, will need some farther touching to
harmonize them: but they do so in a very narrow space, marked distinctly all the way up the
trunk; and it is easier and safer, therefore, to keep them separate at first. Whereas it often
happens that the whole beauty of two colours will depend on the one being continued well through
the other, and playing in the midst of it: blue and green often do so in water: blue and grey,
or purple and scarlet, in sky; in hundreds of such instances the most beautiful and truthful
results may be obtained by laying one colour into the other while wet; judging wisely how far
it will spread, or blending it with the brush in somewhat thicker consistence of wet body-colour;
only observe, never mix in this way two mixtures; let the colour you lay into the other be
always a simple, not a compound tint.

B. Laying one colour over another.

If you lay on a solid touch of vermilion, and, after it is quite dry, strike a little very
wet carmine quickly over it, you will obtain a much more brilliant red than by mixing the carmine
and vermilion. Similarly, if you lay a dark colour first, and strike a little blue or white
body-colour lightly over it, you will get a more beautiful grey than by mixing the colour and
the blue or white. In very perfect painting, artifices of this kind are continually used; but
I would not have you trust much to them; they are apt to make you think too much of quality
of colour. I should like you to depend on little more than the dead colours, simply laid on,
only observe always this, that the less colour you do the work with, the better it will always
be:[240] so that if you have laid a red colour, and you want a purple one above, do not mix
the purple on your palette and lay it on so thick as to overpower the red, but take a little
thin blue from your palette, and lay it lightly over the red, so as to let the red be seen
through, and thus produce the required purple; and if you want a green hue over a blue one,
do not lay a quantity of green on the blue, but a little yellow, and so on, always bringing
the under colour into service as far as you possibly can. If, however, the colour beneath is
wholly opposed to the one you have to lay on, as, suppose, if green is to be laid over scarlet,
you must either remove the required parts of the under colour daintily first with your knife,
or with water; or else, lay solid white over it massively, and leave that to dry, and then
glaze the white with the upper colour. This is better, in general, than laying the upper colour
itself so thick as to conquer the ground, which, in fact, if it be a transparent colour, you
cannot do. Thus, if you have to strike warm boughs and leaves of trees over blue sky, and they
are too intricate to have their places left for them in laying the blue, it is better to lay
them first in solid white, and then glaze with sienna and ochre, than to mix the sienna and
white; though, of course, the process is longer and more troublesome. Nevertheless, if the
forms of touches required are very delicate, the after glazing is impossible. You must then
mix the warm colour thick at once, and so use it: and this is often necessary for delicate
grasses, and such other fine threads of light in foreground work.

C. Breaking one colour in small points through or over another.

This is the most important of all processes in good modern[241] oil and water-colour painting,
but you need not hope to attain very great skill in it. To do it well is very laborious, and
requires such skill and delicacy of hand as can only be acquired by unceasing practice. But
you will find advantage in noting the following points:

(a.) In distant effects of rich subjects, wood, or rippled water, or broken clouds, much may
be done by touches or crumbling dashes of rather dry colour, with other colours afterwards
put cunningly into the interstices. The more you practise this, when the subject evidently
calls for it, the more your eye will enjoy the higher qualities of colour. The process is,
in fact, the carrying out of the principle of separate colours to the utmost possible refinement;
using atoms of colour in juxtaposition, instead of large spaces. And note, in filling up minute
interstices of this kind, that if you want the colour you fill them with to show brightly,
it is better to put a rather positive point of it, with a little white left beside or round
it in the interstice, than to put a pale tint of the colour over the whole interstice. Yellow
or orange will hardly show, if pale, in small spaces; but they show brightly in firm touches,
however small, with white beside them.

(b.) If a colour is to be darkened by superimposed portions of another, it is, in many cases,
better to lay the uppermost colour in rather vigorous small touches, like finely chopped straw,
over the under one, than to lay it on as a tint, for two reasons: the first, that the play
of the two colours together is pleasant to the eye; the second, that much expression of form
may be got by wise administration of the upper dark touches. In distant mountains they may
be made pines of, or broken crags, or villages, or stones, or whatever you choose; in clouds
they may indicate the direction of the rain, the roll and outline of the cloud masses; and
in water, the minor waves. All noble effects of dark atmosphere are got in good water-colour
drawing by these two expedients, interlacing the colours, or retouching the lower one with
fine darker drawing in an upper. Sponging and washing for dark atmospheric effect is barbarous,
and mere tyro's work, though it is often useful for passages of delicate atmospheric light.

(c.) When you have time, practice the production of mixed tints by interlaced touches of the
pure colours out of which they are formed, and use the process at the parts of your sketches
where you wish to get rich and luscious effects. Study the works of William Hunt, of the Old
Water-colour Society, in this respect, continually, and make frequent memoranda of the variegations
in flowers; not painting the flower completely, but laying the ground colour of one petal,
and painting the spots on it with studious precision: a series of single petals of lilies,
geraniums, tulips, &c., numbered with proper reference to their position in the flower, will
be interesting to you on many grounds besides those of art. Be careful to get the gradated
distribution of the spots well followed in the calceolarias, foxgloves, and the like; and work
out the odd, indefinite hues of the spots themselves with minute grains of pure interlaced
colour, otherwise you will never get their richness of bloom. You will be surprised to find,
as you do this, first the universality of the law of gradation we have so much insisted upon;
secondly, that Nature is just as economical of her fine colours as I have told you to be of
yours. You would think, by the way she paints, that her colours cost her something enormous:
she will only give you a single pure touch just where the petal turns into light; but down
in the bell all is subdued, and under the petal all is subdued, even in the showiest flower.
What you thought was bright blue is, when you look close, only dusty grey, or green, or purple,
or every colour in the world at once, only a single gleam or streak of pure blue in the centre
of it. And so with all her colours. Sometimes I have really thought her miserliness intolerable:
in a gentian, for instance, the way she economises her ultramarine down in the bell is a little
too bad.

Next, respecting general tone. I said, just now, that, for the sake of students, my tax should
not be laid on black or on white pigments; but if you mean to be a colourist, you must lay
a tax on them yourselves when you begin to use true colour; that is to say, you must use them
little and make of them much. There is no better test of your colour tones being good, than
your having made the white in your picture precious, and the black conspicuous.

I say, first, the white precious. I do not mean merely glittering or brilliant; it is easy
to scratch white seagulls out of black clouds and dot clumsy foliage with chalky dew; but,
when white is well managed, it ought to be strangely delicious--tender as well as bright--like
inlaid mother of pearl, or white roses washed in milk. The eye ought to seek it for rest, brilliant
though it may be; and to feel it as a space of strange, heavenly paleness in the midst of the
flushing of the colours. This effect you can only reach by general depth of middle tint, by
absolutely refusing to allow any white to exist except where you need it, and by keeping the
white itself subdued by grey, except at a few points of chief lustre.

Secondly, you must make the black conspicuous. However small a point of black may be, it ought
to catch the eye, otherwise your work is too heavy in the shadow. All the ordinary shadows
should be of some colour--never black, nor approaching black, they should be evidently and
always of a luminous nature, and the black should look strange among them; never occurring
except in a black object, or in small points indicative of intense shade in the very centre
of masses of shadow. Shadows of absolutely negative grey, however, may be beautifully used
with white, or with gold; but still though the black thus, in subdued strength, becomes spacious,
it should always be conspicuous; the spectator should notice this grey neutrality with some
wonder, and enjoy, all the more intensely on account of it, the gold colour and the white which
it relieves. Of all the great colourists Velasquez is the greatest master of the black chords.
His black is more precious than most other people's crimson.

It is not, however, only white and black which you must make valuable; you must give rare worth
to every colour you use; but the white and black ought to separate themselves quaintly from
the rest, while the other colours should be continually passing one into the other, being all
evidently companions in the same gay world; while the white, black, and neutral grey should
stand monkishly aloof in the midst of them. You may melt your crimson into purple, your purple
into blue and your blue into green, but you must not melt any of them into black. You should,
however, try, as I said, to give preciousness to all your colours; and this especially by never
using a grain more than will just do the work, and giving each hue the highest value by opposition.
All fine colouring, like fine drawing, is delicate; and so delicate that if, at last, you see
the colour you are putting on, you are putting on too much. You ought to feel a change wrought
in the general tone, by touches of colour which individually are too pale to be seen; and if
there is one atom of any colour in the whole picture which is unnecessary to it, that atom
hurts it.

Notice also, that nearly all good compound colours are odd colours. You shall look at a hue
in a good painter's work ten minutes before you know what to call it. You thought it was brown,
presently, you feel that it is red; next that there is, somehow, yellow in it; presently afterwards
that there is blue in it. If you try to copy it you will always find your colour too warm or
too cold--no colour in the box will seem to have any affinity with it; and yet it will be as
pure as if it were laid at a single touch with a single colour.

As to the choice and harmony of colours in general, if you cannot choose and harmonize them
by instinct, you will never do it at all. If you need examples of utterly harsh and horrible
colour, you may find plenty given in treatises upon colouring, to illustrate the laws of harmony;
and if you want to colour beautifully, colour as best pleases yourself at quiet times, not
so as to catch the eye, nor to look as if it were clever or difficult to colour in that way,
but so that the colour may be pleasant to you when you are happy, or thoughtful. Look much
at the morning and evening sky, and much at simple flowers--dog-roses, wood hyacinths, violets,
poppies, thistles, heather, and such like--as Nature arranges them in the woods and fields.
If ever any scientific person tells you that two colours are "discordant," make a note of the
two colours, and put them together whenever you can. I have actually heard people say that
blue and green were discordant; the two colours which Nature seems to intend never to be separated
and never to be felt, either of them, in its full beauty without the other!--a peacock's neck,
or a blue sky through green leaves, or a blue wave with green lights though it, being precisely
the loveliest things, next to clouds at sunrise, in this coloured world of ours. If you have
a good eye for colours, you will soon find out how constantly Nature puts purple and green
together, purple and scarlet, green and blue, yellow and neutral grey, and the like; and how
she strikes these colour-concords for general tones, and then works into them with innumerable
subordinate ones; and you will gradually come to like what she does, and find out new and beautiful
chords of colour in her work every day. If you enjoy them, depend upon it you will paint them
to a certain point right: or, at least, if you do not enjoy them, you are certain to paint
them wrong. If colour does not give you intense pleasure, let it alone; depend upon it, you
are only tormenting the eyes and senses of people who feel colour, whenever you touch it; and
that is unkind and improper. You will find, also, your power of colouring depend much on your
state of health and right balance of mind; when you are fatigued or ill you will not see colours
well, and when you are ill-tempered you will not choose them well: thus, though not infallibly
a test of character in individuals, colour power is a great sign of mental health in nations;
when they are in a state of intellectual decline, their colouring always gets dull.[242] You
must also take great care not to be misled by affected talk about colour from people who have
not the gift of it: numbers are eager and voluble about it who probably never in all their
lives received one genuine colour-sensation. The modern religionists of the school of Overbeck
are just like people who eat slate-pencil and chalk, and assure everybody that they are nicer
and purer than strawberries and plums.

Take care also never to be misled into any idea that colour can help or display form; colour[243]
always disguises form, and is meant to do so.

It is a favourite dogma among modern writers on colour that "warm colours" (reds and yellows)
"approach" or express nearness, and "cold colours" (blue and grey) "retire" or express distance.
So far is this from being the case, that no expression of distance in the world is so great
as that of the gold and orange in twilight sky. Colours, as such, are ABSOLUTELY inexpressive
respecting distance. It is their quality (as depth, delicacy, &c.) which expresses distance,
not their tint. A blue bandbox set on the same shelf with a yellow one will not look an inch
farther off, but a red or orange cloud, in the upper sky, will always appear to be beyond a
blue cloud close to us, as it is in reality. It is quite true that in certain objects, blue
is a sign of distance; but that is not because blue is a retiring colour, but because the mist
in the air is blue, and therefore any warm colour which has not strength of light enough to
pierce the mist is lost or subdued in its blue: but blue is no more, on this account, a "retiring
colour," than brown is a retiring colour, because, when stones are seen through brown water,
the deeper they lie the browner they look; or than yellow is a retiring colour, because when
objects are seen through a London fog, the farther off they are the yellower they look. Neither
blue, nor yellow, nor red, can have, as such, the smallest power of expressing either nearness
or distance: they express them only under the peculiar circumstances which render them at the
moment, or in that place, signs of nearness or distance. Thus, vivid orange in an orange is
a sign of nearness, for if you put the orange a great way off, its colour will not look so
bright; but vivid orange in sky is a sign of distance, because you cannot get the colour of
orange in a cloud near you. So purple in a violet or a hyacinth is a sign of nearness, because
the closer you look at them the more purple you see. But purple in a mountain is a sign of
distance, because a mountain close to you is not purple, but green or grey. It may, indeed,
be generally assumed that a tender or pale colour will more or less express distance, and a
powerful or dark colour nearness; but even this is not always so. Heathery hills will usually
give a pale and tender purple near, and an intense and dark purple far away; the rose colour
of sunset on snow is pale on the snow at your feet, deep and full on the snow in the distance;
and the green of a Swiss lake is pale in the clear waves on the beach, but intense as an emerald
in the sunstreak, six miles from shore. And in any case, when the foreground is in strong light,
with much water about it, or white surface, casting intense reflections, all its colours may
be perfectly delicate, pale, and faint; while the distance, when it is in shadow, may relieve
the whole foreground with intense darks of purple, blue green, or ultramarine blue. So that,
on the whole, it is quite hopeless and absurd to expect any help from laws of "aërial perspective."
Look for the natural effects, and set them down as fully as you can, and as faithfully, and
never alter a colour because it won't look in its right place. Put the colour strong, if it
be strong, though far off; faint, if it be faint, though close to you. Why should you suppose
that Nature always means you to know exactly how far one thing is from another? She certainly
intends you always to enjoy her colouring, but she does not wish you always to measure her
space. You would be hard put to it, every time you painted the sun setting, if you had to express
his 95,000,000 miles of distance in "aërial perspective."

There is, however, I think, one law about distance, which has some claims to be considered
a constant one: namely, that dullness and heaviness of colour are more or less indicative of
nearness. All distant colour is pure colour: it may not be bright, but it is clear and lovely,
not opaque nor soiled; for the air and light coming between us and any earthy or imperfect
colour, purify or harmonise it; hence a bad colourist is peculiarly incapable of expressing
distance. I do not of course mean that you are to use bad colours in your foreground by way
of making it come forward; but only that a failure in colour, there, will not put it out of
its place; while a failure in colour in the distance will at once do away with its remoteness:
your dull-coloured foreground will still be a foreground, though ill-painted; but your ill-painted
distance will not be merely a dull distance,--it will be no distance at all.

I have only one thing more to advise you, namely, never to colour petulantly or hurriedly.
You will not, indeed, be able, if you attend properly to your colouring, to get anything like
the quantity of form you could in a chiaroscuro sketch; nevertheless, if you do not dash or
rush at your work, nor do it lazily, you may always get enough form to be satisfactory. An
extra quarter of an hour, distributed in quietness over the course of the whole study, may
just make the difference between a quite intelligible drawing, and a slovenly and obscure one.
If you determine well beforehand what outline each piece of colour is to have; and, when it
is on the paper, guide it without nervousness, as far as you can, into the form required; and
then, after it is dry, consider thoroughly what touches are needed to complete it, before laying
one of them on; you will be surprised to find how masterly the work will soon look, as compared
with a hurried or ill-considered sketch. In no process that I know of--least of all in sketching--can
time be really gained by precipitation. It is gained only by caution; and gained in all sorts
of ways: for not only truth of form, but force of light, is always added by an intelligent
and shapely laying of the shadow colours. You may often make a simple flat tint, rightly gradated
and edged, express a complicated piece of subject without a single retouch. The two Swiss cottages,
for instance, with their balconies, and glittering windows, and general character of shingly
eaves, are expressed in Fig. 30., with one tint of grey, and a few dispersed spots and lines
of it; all of which you ought to be able to lay on without more than thrice dipping your brush,
and without a single touch after the tint is dry.

Here, then, for I cannot without coloured illustrations tell you more, I must leave you to
follow out the subject for yourself, with such help as you may receive from the water-colour
drawings accessible to you; or from any of the little treatises on their art which have been
published lately by our water-colour painters.[244] But do not trust much to works of this
kind. You may get valuable hints from them as to mixture of colours; and here and there you
will find a useful artifice or process explained; but nearly all such books are written only
to help idle amateurs to a meretricious skill, and they are full of precepts and principles
which may, for the most part, be interpreted by their precise negatives, and then acted upon,
with advantage. Most of them praise boldness, when the only safe attendant spirit of a beginner
is caution;--advise velocity, when the first condition of success is deliberation;--and plead
for generalisation, when all the foundations of power must be laid in knowledge of specialty.

And now, in the last place, I have a few things to tell you respecting that dangerous nobleness
of consummate art,--COMPOSITION. For though it is quite unnecessary for you yet awhile to attempt
it, and it may be inexpedient for you to attempt it at all, you ought to know what it means,
and to look for and enjoy it in the art of others.

Composition means, literally and simply, putting several things together, so as to make one
thing out of them; the nature and goodness of which they all have a share in producing. Thus
a musician composes an air, by putting notes together in certain relations; a poet composes
a poem; by putting thoughts and words in pleasant order; and a painter a picture, by putting
thoughts, forms, and colours in pleasant order.

In all these cases, observe, an intended unity must be the result of composition. A paviour
cannot be said to compose the heap of stones which he empties from his cart, nor the sower
the handful of seed which he scatters from his hand. It is the essence of composition that
everything should be in a determined place, perform an intended part, and act, in that part,
advantageously for everything that is connected with it.

Composition, understood in this pure sense, is the type, in the arts of mankind, of the Providential
government of the world.[245] It is an exhibition, in the order given to notes, or colours,
or forms, of the advantage of perfect fellowship, discipline, and contentment. In a well-composed
air, no note, however short or low, can be spared, but the least is as necessary as the greatest:
no note, however prolonged, is tedious; but the others prepare for, and are benefited by, its
duration; no note, however high, is tyrannous; the others prepare for and are benefited by,
its exaltation: no note, however low, is overpowered, the others prepare for, and sympathise
with, its humility: and the result is, that each and every note has a value in the position
assigned to it, which by itself, it never possessed, and of which by separation from the others,
it would instantly be deprived.

Similarly, in a good poem, each word and thought enhances the value of those which precede
and follow it; and every syllable has a loveliness which depends not so much on its abstract
sound as on its position. Look at the same word in a dictionary, and you will hardly recognise it.

Much more in a great picture; every line and colour is so arranged as to advantage the rest.
None are inessential, however slight; and none are independent, however forcible. It is not
enough that they truly represent natural objects; but they must fit into certain places, and
gather into certain harmonious groups: so that, for instance, the red chimney of a cottage
is not merely set in its place as a chimney, but that it may affect, in a certain way pleasurable
to the eye, the pieces of green or blue in other parts of the picture; and we ought to see
that the work is masterly, merely by the positions and quantities of these patches of green,
red, and blue, even at a distance which renders it perfectly impossible to determine what the
colours represent: or to see whether the red is a chimney, or an old woman's cloak; and whether
the blue is smoke, sky, or water.

It seems to be appointed, in order to remind us, in all we do, of the great laws of Divine
government and human polity, that composition in the arts should strongly affect every order
of mind, however unlearned or thoughtless. Hence the popular delight in rhythm and metre, and
in simple musical melodies. But it is also appointed that power of composition in the fine
arts should be an exclusive attribute of great intellect All men can more or less copy what
they see, and, more or less, remember it: powers of reflection and investigation are also common
to us all, so that the decision of inferiority in these rests only on questions of degree.
A. has a better memory than B., and C. reflects more profoundly than D. But the gift of composition
is not given at all to more than one man in a thousand; in its highest range, it does not occur
above three or four times in a century.

It follows, from these general truths, that it is impossible to give rules which will enable
you to compose. You might much more easily receive rules to enable you to be witty. If it were
possible to be witty by rule, wit would cease to be either admirable or amusing: if it were
possible to compose melody by rule, Mozart and Cimarosa need not have been born: if it were
possible to compose pictures by rule, Titian and Veronese would be ordinary men. The essence
of composition lies precisely in the fact of its being unteachable, in its being the operation
of an individual mind of range and power exalted above others.

But though no one can invent by rule, there are some simple laws of arrangement which it is
well for you to know, because, though they will not enable you to produce a good picture, they
will often assist you to set forth what goodness may be in your work in a more telling way
than you could have done otherwise; and by tracing them in the work of good composers, you
may better understand the grasp of their imagination, and the power it possesses over their
materials I shall briefly state the chief of these laws.

1. THE LAW OF PRINCIPALITY.

The great object of composition being always to secure unity; that is, to make out of many
things one whole; the first mode in which this can be effected is, by determining that one
feature shall be more important than all the rest, and that the others shall group with it
in subordinate positions.

This is the simplest law of ordinary ornamentation. Thus the group of two leaves, a, Fig. 31.,
is unsatisfactory, because it has no leading leaf; but that at b is prettier, because it has
a head or master leaf; and c more satisfactory still, because the subordination of the other
members to this head leaf is made more manifest by their gradual loss of size as they fall
back from it. Hence part of the pleasure we have in the Greek honeysuckle ornament, and such
others.

Thus, also, good pictures have always one light larger or brighter than the other lights, or
one figure more prominent than the other figures, or one mass of colour dominant over all the
other masses; and in general you will find it much benefit your sketch if you manage that there
shall be one light on the cottage wall, or one blue cloud in the sky, which may attract the
eye as leading light, or leading gloom, above all others. But the observance of the rule is
often so cunningly concealed by the great composers, that its force is hardly at first traceable;
and you will generally find that they are vulgar pictures in which the law is strikingly manifest.
This may be simply illustrated by musical melody; for instance, in such phrases as this:

one note (here the upper G) rules the whole passage, and has the full energy of it concentrated
in itself. Such passages, corresponding to completely subordinated compositions in painting,
are apt to be wearisome if often repeated. But in such a phrase as this:

it is very difficult to say, which is the principal note. The A in the last bar is lightly
dominant, but there is a very equal current of power running through the whole; and such passages
rarely weary. And this principle holds through vast scales of arrangement; so that in the grandest
compositions, such as Paul Veronese's Marriage in Cana, or Raphael's Disputa, it is not easy
to fix at once on the principal figure; and very commonly the figure which is really chief
does not catch the eye at first, but is gradually felt to be more and more conspicuous as we
gaze. Thus in Titian's grand composition of the Cornaro Family, the figure meant to be principal
is a youth of fifteen or sixteen, whose portrait it was evidently the painter's object to make
as interesting as possible. But a grand Madonna, and a St. George with a drifting banner, and
many figures more, occupy the centre of the picture, and first catch the eye; little by little
we are led away from them to a gleam of pearly light in the lower corner, and find that, from
the head which it shines upon, we can turn our eyes no more.

As, in every good picture, nearly all laws of design are more or less exemplified, it will,
on the whole, be an easier way of explaining them to analyse one composition thoroughly, than
to give instances from various works. I shall therefore take one of Turner's simplest; which
will allow us, so to speak, easily to decompose it, and illustrate each law by it as we proceed.

Figure 32. is a rude sketch of the arrangement of the whole subject; the old bridge over the
Moselle at Coblentz, the town of Coblentz on the right, Ehrenbreitstein on the left. The leading
or master feature is, of course the tower on the bridge. It is kept from being too principal
by an important group on each side of it; the boats, on the right, and Ehrenbreitstein beyond.
The boats are large in mass, and more forcible in colour, but they are broken into small divisions,
while the tower is simple, and therefore it still leads. Ehrenbreitstein is noble in its mass,
but so reduced by aërial perspective of colour that it cannot contend with the tower, which
therefore holds the eye, and becomes the key of the picture. We shall see presently how the
very objects which seem at first to contend with it for the mastery are made, occultly to increase
its preëminence.

2. THE LAW OF REPETITION.

Another important means of expressing unity is to mark some kind of sympathy among the different
objects, and perhaps the pleasantest, because most surprising, kind of sympathy, is when one
group imitates or repeats another; not in the way of balance or symmetry, but subordinately,
like a far-away and broken echo of it. Prout has insisted much on this law in all his writings
on composition; and I think it is even more authoritatively present in the minds of most great
composers than the law of principality. It is quite curious to see the pains that Turner sometimes
takes to echo an important passage of colour; in the Pembroke Castle for instance, there are
two fishing-boats, one with a red, and another with a white sail. In a line with them, on the
beach, are two fish in precisely the same relative positions; one red and one white. It is
observable that he uses the artifice chiefly in pictures where he wishes to obtain an expression
of repose: in my notice of the plate of Scarborough, in the series of the "Harbours of England,"
I have already had occasion to dwell on this point, and I extract in the note[246] one or two
sentences which explain the principle. In the composition I have chosen for our illustration,
this reduplication is employed to a singular extent. The tower, or leading feature, is first
repeated by the low echo of it to the left; put your finger over this lower tower, and see
how the picture is spoiled. Then the spires of Coblentz are all arranged in couples (how they
are arranged in reality does not matter; when we are composing a great picture, we must play
the towers about till they come right, as fearlessly as if they were chessmen instead of cathedrals).
The dual arrangement of these towers would have been too easily seen, were it not for a little
one which pretends to make a triad of the last group on the right, but is so faint as hardly
to be discernible: it just takes off the attention from the artifice, helped in doing so by
the mast at the head of the boat, which, however, has instantly its own duplicate put at the
stern.[247] Then there is the large boat near, and its echo beyond it. That echo is divided
into two again, and each of those two smaller boats has two figures in it; while two figures
are also sitting together on the great rudder that lies half in the water, and half aground.
Then, finally, the great mass of Ehrenbreitstein, which appears at first to have no answering
form, has almost its facsimile in the bank on which the girl is sitting; this bank is as absolutely
essential to the completion of the picture as any object in the whole series. All this is done
to deepen the effect of repose.

Symmetry or the balance of parts or masses in nearly equal opposition, is one of the conditions
of treatment under the law of Repetition. For the opposition, in a symmetrical object, is of
like things reflecting each other; it is not the balance of contrary natures (like that of
day and night) but of like natures or like forms; one side of a leaf being set like the reflection
of the other in water.

Symmetry in Nature is, however, never formal nor accurate. She takes the greatest care to secure
some difference between the corresponding things or parts of things; and an approximation to
accurate symmetry is only permitted in animals because their motions secure perpetual difference
between the balancing parts. Stand before a mirror; hold your arms in precisely the same position
at each side, your head upright your body straight; divide your hair exactly in the middle,
and get it as nearly as you can into exactly the same shape over each ear, and you will see
the effect of accurate symmetry; you will see, no less, how all grace and power in the human
form result from the interference of motion and life with symmetry, and from the reconciliation
of its balance with its changefulness. Your position, as seen in the mirror, is the highest
type of symmetry as understood by modern architects.

In many sacred compositions, living symmetry, the balance of harmonious opposites, is one of
the profoundest sources of their power: almost any works of the early painters, Angelico, Perugino,
Giotto, &c., will furnish you with notable instances of it. The Madonna of Perugino in the
National Gallery, with the angel Michael on one side and Raphael on the other, is as beautiful
an example as you can have.

In landscape, the principle of balance is more or less carried out in proportion to the wish
of the painter to express disciplined calmness. In bad compositions as in bad architecture,
it is formal, a tree on one side answering a tree on the other; but in good compositions, as
in graceful statues, it is always easy, and sometimes hardly traceable. In the Coblentz, however,
you cannot have much difficulty in seeing how the boats on one side of the tower and the figures
on the other are set in nearly equal balance; the tower, as a central mass uniting both.

3. THE LAW OF CONTINUITY.

Another important and pleasurable way of expressing unity is by giving some orderly succession
to a number of objects more or less similar. And this succession is most interesting when it
is connected with some gradual change in the aspect or character of the objects. Thus the succession
of the pillars of a cathedral aisle is most interesting when they retire in perspective, becoming
more and more obscure in distance; so the succession of mountain promontories one behind another,
on the flanks of a valley; so the succession of clouds, fading farther and farther towards
the horizon; each promontory and each cloud being of different shape, yet all evidently following
in a calm and appointed order. If there be no change at all in the shape or size of the objects,
there is no continuity; there is only repetition--monotony. It is the change in shape which
suggests the idea of their being individually free, and able to escape, if they liked, from
the law that rules them, and yet submitting to it. I will leave our chosen illustrative composition
for a moment to take up another, still more expressive of this law. It is one of Turner's most
tender studies, a sketch on Calais Sands at sunset; so delicate in the expression of wave and
cloud, that it is of no use for me to try to reach it with any kind of outline in a woodcut;
but the rough sketch, Fig. 33., is enough to give an idea of its arrangement. The aim of the
painter has been to give the intensest expression of repose, together with the enchanted lulling,
monotonous motion of cloud and wave. All the clouds are moving in innumerable ranks after the
sun, meeting towards the point in the horizon where he has set; and the tidal waves gain in
winding currents upon the sand, with that stealthy haste in which they cross each other so
quietly, at their edges: just folding one over another as they meet, like a little piece of
ruffled silk, and leaping up a little as two children kiss and clap their hands, and then going
on again, each in its silent hurry, drawing pointed arches on the sand as their thin edges
intersect in parting; but all this would not have been enough expressed without the line of
the old pier-timbers, black with weeds, strained and bent by the storm waves, and now seeming
to stoop in following one another, like dark ghosts escaping slowly from the cruelty of the
pursuing sea.

I need not, I hope, point out to the reader the illustration of this law of continuance in
the subject chosen for our general illustration. It was simply that gradual succession of the
retiring arches of the bridge which induced Turner to paint the subject at all; and it was
this same principle which led him always to seize on subjects including long bridges where-ever
he could find them; but especially, observe, unequal bridges, having the highest arch at one
side rather than at the centre. There is a reason for this, irrespective of general laws of
composition, and connected with the nature of rivers, which I may as well stop a minute to
tell you about, and let you rest from the study of composition.

All rivers, small or large, agree in one character, they like to lean a little on one side:
they cannot bear to have their channels deepest in the middle, but will always, if they can,
have one bank to sun themselves upon, and another to get cool under; one shingly shore to play
over, where they may be shallow, and foolish, and childlike, and another steep shore, under
which they can pause, and purify themselves, and get their strength of waves fully together
for due occasion. Rivers in this way are just like wise men, who keep one side of their life
for play, and another for work; and can be brilliant, and chattering, and transparent, when
they are at ease, and yet take deep counsel on the other side when they set themselves to their
main purpose. And rivers are just in this divided, also, like wicked and good men: the good
rivers have serviceable deep places all along their banks, that ships can sail in; but the
wicked rivers go scoopingly irregularly under their banks until they get full of strangling
eddies, which no boat can row over without being twisted against the rocks; and pools like
wells, which no one can get out of but the water-kelpie that lives at the bottom;--but, wicked
or good, the rivers all agree in having two kinds of sides. Now the natural way in which a
village stonemason therefore throws a bridge over a strong stream is, of course, to build a
great door to let the cat through, and little doors to let the kittens through; a great arch
for the great current, to give it room in flood time, and little arches for the little currents
along the shallow shore. This, even without any prudential respect for the floods of the great
current, he would do in simple economy of work and stone; for the smaller your arches are,
the less material you want on their flanks. Two arches over the same span of river, supposing
the butments are at the same depth, are cheaper than one, and that by a great deal; so that,
where the current is shallow, the village mason makes his arches many and low; as the water
gets deeper, and it becomes troublesome to build his piers up from the bottom, he throws his
arches wider; at last he comes to the deep stream, and, as he cannot build at the bottom of
that, he throws his largest arch over it with a leap, and with another little one or so gains
the opposite shore. Of course as arches are wider they must be higher, or they will not stand;
so the roadway must rise as the arches widen. And thus we have the general type of bridge,
with its highest and widest arch towards one side, and a train of minor arches running over
the flat shore on the other; usually a steep bank at the river-side next the large arch; always,
of course, a flat shore on the side of the small ones; and the bend of the river assuredly
concave towards this flat, cutting round, with a sweep into the steep bank; or, if there is
no steep bank, still assuredly cutting into the shore at the steep end of the bridge.

Now this kind of bridge, sympathising, as it does, with the spirit of the river, and marking
the nature of the thing it has to deal with and conquer, is the ideal of a bridge; and all
endeavours to do the thing in a grand engineer's manner, with a level roadway and equal arches,
are barbarous; not only because all monotonous forms are ugly in themselves, but because the
mind perceives at once that there has been cost uselessly thrown away for the sake of formality.[248]

Well, to return to our continuity. We see that the Turnerian bridge in Fig. 32. is of the absolutely
perfect type, and is still farther interesting by having its main arch crowned by a watch-tower.
But as I want you to note especially what perhaps was not the case in the real bridge, but
is entirely Turner's doing, you will find that though the arches diminish gradually, not one
is regularly diminished--they are all of different shapes and sizes: you cannot see this clearly
in 32., but in the larger diagram, Fig. 34., opposite, you will with ease. This is indeed also
part of the ideal of a bridge, because the lateral currents near the shore are of course irregular
in size, and a simple builder would naturally vary his arches accordingly; and also, if the
bottom was rocky, build his piers where the rocks came. But it is not as a part of bridge ideal,
but as a necessity of all noble composition, that this irregularity is introduced by Turner.
It at once raises the object thus treated from the lower or vulgar unity of rigid law to the
greater unity of clouds, and waves, and trees, and human souls, each different, each obedient,
and each in harmonious service.

4. THE LAW OF CURVATURE.

There is, however, another point to be noticed in this bridge of Turner's. Not only does it
slope away unequally at its sides, but it slopes in a gradual though very subtle curve. And
if you substitute a straight line for this curve (drawing one with a rule from the base of
the tower on each side to the ends of the bridge, in Fig. 34., and effacing the curve), you
will instantly see that the design has suffered grievously. You may ascertain, by experiment,
that all beautiful objects whatsoever are thus terminated by delicately curved lines, except
where the straight line is indispensable to their use or stability: and that when a complete
system of straight lines, throughout the form, is necessary to that stability, as in crystals,
the beauty, if any exists, is in colour and transparency, not in form. Cut out the shape of
any crystal you like, in white wax or wood, and put it beside a white lily, and you will feel
the force of the curvature in its purity, irrespective of added colour, or other interfering
elements of beauty.

Well, as curves are more beautiful than straight lines, it is necessary to a good composition
that its continuities of object, mass, or colour should be, if possible, in curves, rather
than straight lines or angular ones. Perhaps one of the simplest and prettiest examples of
a graceful continuity of this kind is in the line traced at any moment by the corks of a net
as it is being drawn: nearly every person is more or less attracted by the beauty of the dotted
line. Now it is almost always possible, not only to secure such a continuity in the arrangement
or boundaries of objects which, like these bridge arches or the corks of the net, are actually
connected with each other, but--and this is a still more noble and interesting kind of continuity--among
features which appear at first entirely separate. Thus the towers of Ehrenbreitstein, on the
left, in Fig. 32., appear at first independent of each other; but when I give their profile,
on a larger scale, Fig. 35., the reader may easily perceive that there is a subtle cadence
and harmony among them. The reason of this is, that they are all bounded by one grand curve,
traced by the dotted line; out of the seven towers, four precisely touch this curve, the others
only falling back from it here and there to keep the eye from discovering it too easily.

And it is not only always possible to obtain continuities of this kind: it is, in drawing large
forest or mountain forms essential to truth. The towers of Ehrenbreitstein might or might not
in reality fall into such a curve, but assuredly the basalt rock on which they stand did; for
all mountain forms not cloven into absolute precipice, nor covered by straight slopes of shales,
are more or less governed by these great curves, it being one of the aims of Nature in all
her work to produce them. The reader must already know this, if he has been able to sketch
at all among the mountains; if not, let him merely draw for himself, carefully, the outlines
of any low hills accessible to him, where they are tolerably steep, or of the woods which grow
on them. The steeper shore of the Thames at Maidenhead, or any of the downs at Brighton or
Dover, or, even nearer, about Croydon (as Addington Hills), are easily accessible to a Londoner;
and he will soon find not only how constant, but how graceful the curvature is. Graceful curvature
is distinguished from ungraceful by two characters: first, its moderation, that is to say,
its close approach to straightness in some parts of its course;[249] and, secondly, by its
variation, that is to say, its never remaining equal in degree at different parts of its course.

This variation is itself twofold in all good curves.

A. There is, first, a steady change through the whole line from less to more curvature, or
more to less, so that no part of the line is a segment of a circle, or can be drawn by compasses
in any way whatever. Thus, in Fig. 36., a is a bad curve, because it is part of a circle, and
is therefore monotonous throughout; but b is a good curve, because it continually changes its
direction as it proceeds.

The first difference between good and bad drawing of tree boughs consists in observance of
this fact. Thus, when I put leaves on the line b, as in Fig. 37., you can immediately feel
the springiness of character dependent on the changefulness of the curve. You may put leaves
on the other line for yourself, but you will find you cannot make a right tree spray of it.
For all tree boughs, large or small, as well as all noble natural lines whatsoever, agree in
this character; and it is a point of primal necessity that your eye should always seize and
your hand trace it. Here are two more portions of good curves, with leaves put on them at the
extremities instead of the flanks, Fig. 38.; and two showing the arrangement of masses of foliage
seen a little farther off, Fig. 39., which you may in like manner amuse yourself by turning
into segments of circles--you will see with what result. I hope, however, you have beside you
by this time, many good studies of tree boughs carefully made, in which you may study variations
of curvature in their most complicated and lovely forms.[250]

B. Not only does every good curve vary in general tendency, but it is modulated, as it proceeds,
by myriads of subordinate curves. Thus the outlines of a tree trunk are never as at a, Fig.
40, but as at b. So also in waves, clouds, and all other nobly formed masses. Thus another
essential difference between good and bad drawing, or good and bad sculpture, depends on the
quantity and refinement of minor curvatures carried, by good work, into the great lines. Strictly
speaking, however, this is not variation in large curves, but composition of large curves out
of small ones; it is an increase in the quantity of the beautiful element, but not a change
in its nature.

5. THE LAW OF RADIATION.

We have hitherto been concerned only with the binding of our various objects into beautiful
lines or processions. The next point we have to consider is, how we may unite these lines or
processions themselves, so as to make groups of them.

Now, there are two kinds of harmonies of lines. One in which, moving more or less side by side,
they variously, but evidently with consent, retire from or approach each other, intersect or
oppose each other: currents of melody in music, for different voices, thus approach and cross,
fall and rise, in harmony; so the waves of the sea, as they approach the shore, flow into one
another or cross, but with a great unity through all; and so various lines of composition often
flow harmoniously through and across each other in a picture. But the most simple and perfect
connexion of lines is by radiation; that is, by their all springing from one point, or closing
towards it: and this harmony is often, in Nature almost always, united with the other; as the
boughs of trees, though they intersect and play amongst each other irregularly, indicate by
their general tendency their origin from one root. An essential part of the beauty of all vegetable
form is in this radiation: it is seen most simply in a single flower or leaf, as in a convolvulus
bell, or chestnut leaf; but more beautifully in the complicated arrangements of the large boughs
and sprays. For a leaf is only a flat piece of radiation; but the tree throws its branches
on all sides, and even in every profile view of it, which presents a radiation more or less
correspondent to that of its leaves, it is more beautiful, because varied by the freedom of
the separate branches. I believe it has been ascertained that, in all trees, the angle at which,
in their leaves, the lateral ribs are set on their central rib is approximately the same at
which the branches leave the great stem; and thus each section of the tree would present a
kind of magnified view of its own leaf, were it not for the interfering force of gravity on
the masses of foliage. This force in proportion to their age, and the lateral leverage upon
them, bears them downwards at the extremities, so that, as before noticed, the lower the bough
grows on the stem, the more it droops (Fig. 17, p. 295.); besides this, nearly all beautiful
trees have a tendency to divide into two or more principal masses, which give a prettier and
more complicated symmetry than if one stem ran all the way up the centre. Fig. 41. may thus
be considered the simplest type of tree radiation, as opposed to leaf radiation. In this figure,
however, all secondary ramification is unrepresented, for the sake of simplicity; but if we
take one half of such a tree, and merely give two secondary branches to each main branch (as
represented in the general branch structure shown at b, Fig. 18., p. 296), we shall have the
form, Fig. 42. This I consider the perfect general type of tree structure; and it is curiously
connected with certain forms of Greek, Byzantine, and Gothic ornamentation, into the discussion
of which, however, we must not enter here. It will be observed, that both in Figs. 41. and
42. all the branches so spring from the main stem as very nearly to suggest their united radiation
from the root R. This is by no means universally the case; but if the branches do not bend
towards a point in the root, they at least converge to some point or other. In the examples
in Fig. 43., the mathematical centre of curvature, a, is thus, in one case, on the ground at
some distance from the root, and in the other, near the top of the tree. Half, only, of each
tree is given, for the sake of clearness: Fig. 44. gives both sides of another example, in
which the origins of curvature are below the root. As the positions of such points may be varied
without end, and as the arrangement of the lines is also farther complicated by the fact of
the boughs springing for the most part in a spiral order round the tree, and at proportionate
distances, the systems of curvature which regulate the form of vegetation are quite infinite.
Infinite is a word easily said, and easily written, and people do not always mean it when they
say it; in this case I do mean it; the number of systems is incalculable, and even to furnish
any thing like a representative number of types, I should have to give several hundreds of
figures such as Fig. 44.[251]

Thus far, however, we have only been speaking of the great relations of stem and branches.
The forms of the branches themselves are regulated by still more subtle laws, for they occupy
an intermediate position between the form of the tree and of the leaf. The leaf has a flat
ramification; the tree a completely rounded one; the bough is neither rounded nor flat, but
has a structure exactly balanced between the two, in a half-flattened, half-rounded flake,
closely resembling in shape one of the thick leaves of an artichoke or the flake of a fir cone;
by combination forming the solid mass of the tree, as the leaves compose the artichoke head.
I have before pointed out to you the general resemblance of these branch flakes to an extended
hand; but they may be more accurately represented by the ribs of a boat. If you can imagine
a very broad-headed and flattened boat applied by its keel to the end of a main branch,[252]
as in Fig. 45., the lines which its ribs will take, and the general contour of it, as seen
in different directions, from above and below; and from one side and another, will give you
the closest approximation to the perspectives and foreshortenings of a well-grown branch-flake.
Fig. 25. above, page 316., is an unharmed and unrestrained shoot of healthy young oak; and
if you compare it with Fig. 45., you will understand at once the action of the lines of leafage;
the boat only failing as a type in that its ribs are too nearly parallel to each other at the
sides, while the bough sends all its ramification well forwards, rounding to the head, that
it may accomplish its part in the outer form of the whole tree, yet always securing the compliance
with the great universal law that the branches nearest the root bend most back; and, of course,
throwing some always back as well as forwards; the appearance of reversed action being much
increased, and rendered more striking and beautiful, by perspective. Figure 25. shows the perspective
of such a bough as it is seen from below; Fig. 46. gives rudely the look it would have from above.

You may suppose, if you have not already discovered, what subtleties of perspective and light
and shade are involved in the drawing of these branch-flakes, as you see them in different
directions and actions; now raised, now depressed; touched on the edges by the wind, or lifted
up and bent back so as to show all the white under surfaces of the leaves shivering in light,
as the bottom of a boat rises white with spray at the surge-crest; or drooping in quietness
towards the dew of the grass beneath them in windless mornings, or bowed down under oppressive
grace of deep-charged snow. Snow time, by the way, is one of the best for practice in the placing
of tree masses; but you will only be able to understand them thoroughly by beginning with a
single bough and a few leaves placed tolerably even, as in Fig. 38. page 372. First one with
three leaves, a central and two lateral ones, as at a; then with five, as at b, and so on;
directing your whole attention to the expression, both by contour and light and shade, of the
boat-like arrangements, which in your earlier studies, will have been a good deal confused,
partly owing to your inexperience, and partly to the depth of shade, or absolute blackness
of mass required in those studies.

One thing more remains to be noted, and I will let you out of the wood. You see that in every
generally representative figure I have surrounded the radiating branches with a dotted line:
such lines do indeed terminate every vegetable form; and you see that they are themselves beautiful
curves, which, according to their flow, and the width or narrowness of the spaces they enclose,
characterize the species of tree or leaf, and express its free or formal action, its grace
of youth or weight of age. So that, throughout all the freedom of her wildest foliage, Nature
is resolved on expressing an encompassing limit; and marking a unity in the whole tree, caused
not only by the rising of its branches from a common root, but by their joining in one work,
and being bound by a common law. And having ascertained this, let us turn back for a moment
to a point in leaf structure which, I doubt not, you must already have observed in your earlier
studies, but which it is well to state here, as connected with the unity of the branches in
the great trees. You must have noticed, I should think, that whenever a leaf is compound,--that
is to say, divided into other leaflets which in any way repeat or imitate the form of the whole
leaf,--those leaflets are not symmetrical as the whole leaf is, but always smaller on the side
towards the point of the great leaf, so as to express their subordination to it, and show,
even when they are pulled off, that they are not small independent leaves, but members of one
large leaf.

Fig. 47., which is a block-plan of a leaf of columbine, without its minor divisions on the
edges, will illustrate the principle clearly. It is composed of a central large mass, A, and
two lateral ones, of which the one on the right only is lettered, B. Each of these masses is
again composed of three others, a central and two lateral ones; but observe, the minor one,
a of A, is balanced equally by its opposite; but the minor b1 of B is larger than its opposite
b2. Again, each of these minor masses is divided into three; but while the central mass, A
of A, is symmetrically divided, the B of B is unsymmetrical, its largest side-lobe being lowest.
Again b2, the lobe c1 (its lowest lobe in relation to B) is larger than c2; and so also in
b1. So that universally one lobe of a lateral leaf is always larger than the other, and the
smaller lobe is that which is nearer the central mass; the lower leaf, as it were by courtesy,
subduing some of its own dignity or power, in the immediate presence of the greater or captain
leaf; and always expressing, therefore, its own subordination and secondary character. This
law is carried out even in single leaves. As far as I know, the upper half, towards the point
of the spray, is always the smaller; and a slightly different curve, more convex at the springing,
is used for the lower side, giving an exquisite variety to the form of the whole leaf; so that
one of the chief elements in the beauty of every subordinate leaf throughout the tree, is made
to depend on its confession of its own lowliness and subjection.

And now, if we bring together in one view the principles we have ascertained in trees, we shall
find they may be summed under four great laws; and that all perfect[253] vegetable form is
appointed to express these four laws in noble balance of authority.

1. Support from one living root.

2. Radiation, or tendency of force from some one given point, either in the root, or in some
stated connexion with it.

3. Liberty of each bough to seek its own livelihood and happiness according to its needs, by
irregularities of action both in its play and its work, either stretching out to get its required
nourishment from light and rain, by finding some sufficient breathing-place among the other
branches, or knotting and gathering itself up to get strength for any load which its fruitful
blossoms may lay upon it, and for any stress of its storm-tossed luxuriance of leaves; or playing
hither and thither as the fitful sunshine may tempt its young shoots, in their undecided states
of mind about their future life.

4. Imperative requirement of each bough to stop within certain limits, expressive of its kindly
fellowship and fraternity with the boughs in its neighborhood; and to work with them according
to its power, magnitude, and state of health, to bring out the general perfectness of the great
curve, and circumferent stateliness of the whole tree.

I think I may leave you, unhelped, to work out the moral analogies of these laws; you may,
perhaps, however, be a little puzzled to see the meeting of the second one. It typically expresses
that healthy human actions should spring radiantly (like rays) from some single heart motive;
the most beautiful systems of action taking place when this motive lies at the root of the
whole life, and the action is clearly seen to proceed from it; while also many beautiful secondary
systems of action taking place from motives not so deep or central, but in some beautiful subordinate
connexion with the central or life motive.

The other laws, if you think over them, you will find equally significative; and as you draw
trees more and more in their various states of health and hardship, you will be every day more
struck by the beauty of the types they present of the truths most essential for mankind to
know;[254] and you will see what this vegetation of the earth, which is necessary to our life,
first, as purifying the air for us and then as food, and just as necessary to our joy in all
places of the earth,--what these trees and leaves, I say, are meant to teach us as we contemplate
them, and read or hear their lovely language, written or spoken for us, not in frightful black
letters, nor in dull sentences, but in fair green and shadowy shapes of waving words, and blossomed
brightness of odoriferous wit, and sweet whispers of unintrusive wisdom, and playful morality.

Well, I am sorry myself to leave the wood, whatever my reader may be; but leave it we must,
or we shall compose no more pictures to-day.

This law of radiation, then, enforcing unison of action in arising from, or proceeding to,
some given point, is perhaps, of all principles of composition, the most influential in producing
the beauty of groups of form. Other laws make them forcible or interesting, but this generally
is chief in rendering them beautiful. In the arrangement of masses in pictures, it is constantly
obeyed by the great composers; but, like the law of principality, with careful concealment
of its imperativeness, the point to which the lines of main curvature are directed being very
often far away out of the picture. Sometimes, however, a system of curves will be employed
definitely to exalt, by their concurrence, the value of some leading object, and then the law
becomes traceable enough.

In the instance before us, the principal object being, as we have seen, the tower on the bridge,
Turner has determined that his system of curvature should have its origin in the top of this
tower. The diagram Fig. 34. page 369, compared with Fig. 32. page 361, will show how this is
done. One curve joins the two towers, and is continued by the back of the figure sitting on
the bank into the piece of bent timber. This is a limiting curve of great importance, and Turner
has drawn a considerable part of it with the edge of the timber very carefully, and then led
the eye up to the sitting girl by some white spots and indications of a ledge in the bank;
then the passage to the tops of the towers cannot be missed.

The next curve is begun and drawn carefully for half an inch of its course by the rudder; it
is then taken up by the basket and the heads of the figures, and leads accurately to the tower
angle. The gunwales of both the boats begin the next two curves, which meet in the same point;
and all are centralised by the long reflection which continues the vertical lines.

Subordinated to this first system of curves there is another, begun by the small crossing bar
of wood inserted in the angle behind the rudder; continued by the bottom of the bank on which
the figure sits, interrupted forcibly beyond it,[255] but taken up again by the water-line
leading to the bridge foot, and passing on in delicate shadows under the arches, not easily
shown in so rude a diagram, towards the other extremity of the bridge. This is a most important
curve, indicating that the force and sweep of the river have indeed been in old times under
the large arches; while the antiquity of the bridge is told us by the long tongue of land,
either of carted rubbish, or washed down by some minor stream, which has interrupted this curve,
and is now used as a landing-place for the boats, and for embarkation of merchandise, of which
some bales and bundles are laid in a heap, immediately beneath the great tower. A common composer
would have put these bales to one side or the other, but Turner knows better; he uses them
as a foundation for his tower, adding to its importance precisely as the sculptured base adorns
a pillar; and he farther increases the aspect of its height by throwing the reflection of it
far down in the nearer water. All the great composers have this same feeling about sustaining
their vertical masses: you will constantly find Prout using the artifice most dexterously (see,
for instance, the figure with the wheelbarrow under the great tower, in the sketch of St. Nicolas,
at Prague, and the white group of figures under the tower in the sketch of Augsburg[256]);
and Veronese, Titian, and Tintoret continually put their principal figures at bases of pillars.
Turner found out their secret very early, the most prominent instance of his composition on
this principle being the drawing of Turin from the Superga, in Hakewell's Italy.

I chose Fig. 20., already given to illustrate foliage drawing, chiefly because, being another
instance of precisely the same arrangement, it will serve to convince you of its being intentional.
There, the vertical, formed by the larger tree, is continued by the figure of the farmer, and
that of one of the smaller trees by his stick. The lines of the interior mass of the bushes
radiate, under the law of radiation, from a point behind the farmer's head; but their outline
curves are carried on and repeated, under the law of continuity, by the curves of the dog and
boy--by the way, note the remarkable instance in these of the use of darkest lines towards
the light;--all more or less guiding the eye up to the right, in order to bring it finally
to the Keep of Windsor, which is the central object of the picture, as the bridge tower is
in the Coblentz. The wall on which the boy climbs answers the purpose of contrasting, both
in direction and character, with these greater curves; thus corresponding as nearly as possible
to the minor tongue of land in the Coblentz. This, however, introduces us to another law, which
we must consider separately.

6. THE LAW OF CONTRAST.

Of course the character of everything is best manifested by Contrast. Rest can only be enjoyed
after labour; sound, to be heard clearly, must rise out of silence; light is exhibited by darkness,
darkness by light; and so on in all things. Now in art every colour has an opponent colour,
which, if brought near it, will relieve it more completely than any other; so, also, every
form and line may be made more striking to the eye by an opponent form or line near them; a
curved line is set off by a straight one, a massy form by a slight one, and so on; and in all
good work nearly double the value, which any given colour or form would have uncombined, is
given to each by contrast.[257]

In this case again, however, a too manifest use of the artifice vulgarises a picture. Great
painters do not commonly, or very visibly, admit violent contrast. They introduce it by stealth
and with intermediate links of tender change; allowing, indeed, the opposition to tell upon
the mind as a surprise, but not as a shock.[258]

Thus in the rock of Ehrenbreitstein, Fig. 35., the main current of the lines being downwards,
in a convex swell, they are suddenly stopped at the lowest tower by a counter series of beds,
directed nearly straight across them. This adverse force sets off and relieves the great curvature,
but it is reconciled to it by a series of radiating lines below, which at first sympathize
with the oblique bar, then gradually get steeper, till they meet and join in the fall of the
great curve. No passage, however intentionally monotonous, is ever introduced by a good artist
without some slight counter current of this kind; so much, indeed, do the great composers feel
the necessity of it, that they will even do things purposely ill or unsatisfactorily, in order
to give greater value to their well-doing in other places. In a skilful poet's versification
the so-called bad or inferior lines are not inferior because he could not do them better, but
because he feels that if all were equally weighty, there would be no real sense of weight anywhere;
if all were equally melodious, the melody itself would be fatiguing; and he purposely introduces
the labouring or discordant verse, that the full ring may be felt in his main sentence, and
the finished sweetness in his chosen rhythm.[259] And continually in painting, inferior artists
destroy their work by giving too much of all that they think is good, while the great painter
gives just enough to be enjoyed, and passes to an opposite kind of enjoyment, or to an inferior
state of enjoyment: he gives a passage of rich, involved, exquisitely wrought colour, then
passes away into slight, and pale and simple colour; he paints for a minute or two with intense
decision, then suddenly becomes, as the spectator thinks, slovenly; but he is not slovenly:
you could not have taken any more decision from him just then; you have had as much as is good
for you; he paints over a great space of his picture forms of the most rounded and melting
tenderness, and suddenly, as you think by a freak, gives you a bit as jagged and sharp as a
leafless blackthorn. Perhaps the most exquisite piece of subtle contrast in the world of painting
is the arrow point, laid sharp against the white side and among the flowing hair of Correggio's
Antiope. It is quite singular how very little contrast will sometimes serve to make an entire
group of forms interesting which would otherwise have been valueless. There is a good deal
of picturesque material, for instance, in this top of an old tower, Fig. 48., tiles and stones
and sloping roof not disagreeably mingled; but all would have been unsatisfactory if there
had not happened to be that iron ring on the inner wall, which by its vigorous black circular
line precisely opposes all the square and angular characters of the battlements and roof. Draw
the tower without the ring, and see what a difference it will make.

One of the most important applications of the law of contrast is in association with the law
of continuity, causing an unexpected but gentle break in a continuous series. This artifice
is perpetual in music, and perpetual also in good illumination; the way in which little surprises
of change are prepared in any current borders, or chains of ornamental design, being one of
the most subtle characteristics of the work of the good periods. We take, for instance, a bar
of ornament between two written columns of an early 14th Century MS., and at the first glance
we suppose it to be quite monotonous all the way up, composed of a winding tendril, with alternately
a blue leaf and a scarlet bud. Presently, however, we see that, in order to observe the law
of principality there is one large scarlet leaf instead of a bud, nearly half-way up, which
forms a centre to the whole rod; and when we begin to examine the order of the leaves, we find
it varied carefully. Let A stand for scarlet bud, b for blue leaf, c for two blue leaves on
one stalk, s for a stalk without a leaf, and R for the large red leaf. Then counting from the
ground, the order begins as follows:

b, b, A; b, s, b, A; b, b, A; b, b, A; and we think we shall have two b's and an A all the
way, when suddenly it becomes b, A; b, R; b, A; b, A; b, A; and we think we are going to have
b, A continued; but no: here it becomes b, s; b, s; b, A; b, s; b, s; c, s; b, s; b, s; and
we think we are surely going to have b, s continued, but behold it runs away to the end with
a quick b, b, A; b, b, b, b![260] Very often, however, the designer is satisfied with one surprise,
but I never saw a good illuminated border without one at least; and no series of any kind is
ever introduced by a great composer in a painting without a snap somewhere. There is a pretty
one in Turner's drawing of Rome, with the large balustrade for a foreground in the Hakewell's
Italy series: the single baluster struck out of the line, and showing the street below through
the gap, simply makes the whole composition right, when otherwise, it would have been stiff
and absurd.

If you look back to Fig. 48. you will see, in the arrangement of the battlements, a simple
instance of the use of such variation. The whole top of the tower, though actually three sides
of a square, strikes the eye as a continuous series of five masses. The first two, on the left,
somewhat square and blank; then the next two higher and richer, the tiles being seen on their
slopes. Both these groups being couples, there is enough monotony in the series to make a change
pleasant; and the last battlement, therefore, is a little higher than the first two,--a little
lower than the second two,--and different in shape from either. Hide it with your finger, and
see how ugly and formal the other four battlements look.

There are in this figure several other simple illustrations of the laws we have been tracing.
Thus the whole shape of the wall's mass being square, it is well, still for the sake of contrast,
to oppose it not only by the element of curvature, in the ring, and lines of the roof below,
but by that of sharpness; hence the pleasure which the eye takes in the projecting point of
the roof. Also because the walls are thick and sturdy, it is well to contrast their strength
with weakness; therefore we enjoy the evident decrepitude of this roof as it sinks between
them. The whole mass being nearly white, we want a contrasting shadow somewhere; and get it,
under our piece of decrepitude. This shade, with the tiles of the wall below, forms another
pointed mass, necessary to the first by the law of repetition. Hide this inferior angle with
your finger, and see how ugly the other looks. A sense of the law of symmetry, though you might
hardly suppose it, has some share in the feeling with which you look at the battlements; there
is a certain pleasure in the opposed slopes of their top, on one side down to the left, on
the other to the right. Still less would you think the law of radiation had anything to do
with the matter: but if you take the extreme point of the black shadow on the left for a centre
and follow first the low curve of the eaves of the wall, it will lead you, if you continue
it, to the point of the tower cornice; follow the second curve, the top of the tiles of the
wall, and it will strike the top of the right-hand battlement; then draw a curve from the highest
point of the angle battlement on the left, through the points of the roof and its dark echo;
and you will see how the whole top of the tower radiates from this lowest dark point. There
are other curvatures crossing these main ones, to keep them from being too conspicuous. Follow
the curve of the upper roof, it will take you to the top of the highest battlement; and the
stones indicated at the right-hand side of the tower are more extended at the bottom, in order
to get some less direct expression of sympathy, such as irregular stones may be capable of,
with the general flow of the curves from left to right.

You may not readily believe, at first, that all these laws are indeed involved in so trifling
a piece of composition. But as you study longer, you will discover that these laws, and many
more, are obeyed by the powerful composers in every touch: that literally, there is never a
dash of their pencil which is not carrying out appointed purposes of this kind in twenty various
ways at once; and that there is as much difference, in way of intention and authority, between
one of the great composers ruling his colours, and a common painter confused by them, as there
is between a general directing the march of an army, and an old lady carried off her feet by a mob.

7. THE LAW OF INTERCHANGE.

Closely connected with the law of contrast is a law which enforces the unity of opposite things,
by giving to each a portion of the character of the other. If, for instance, you divide a shield
into two masses of colour, all the way down--suppose blue and white, and put a bar, or figure
of an animal, partly on one division, partly on the other, you will find it pleasant to the
eye if you make the part of the animal blue which comes upon the white half, and white which
comes upon the blue half. This is done in heraldry, partly for the sake of perfect intelligibility,
but yet more for the sake of delight in interchange of colour, since, in all ornamentation
whatever, the practice is continual, in the ages of good design.

Sometimes this alternation is merely a reversal of contrasts; as that, after red has been for
some time on one side, and blue on the other, red shall pass to blue's side and blue to red's.
This kind of alternation takes place simply in four-quartered shields; in more subtle pieces
of treatment, a little bit only of each colour is carried into the other, and they are as it
were dovetailed together. One of the most curious facts which will impress itself upon you,
when you have drawn some time carefully from Nature in light and shade, is the appearance of
intentional artifice with which contrasts of this alternate kind are produced by her; the artistry
with which she will darken a tree trunk as long as it comes against light sky, and throw sunlight
on it precisely at the spot where it comes against a dark hill, and similarly treat all her
masses of shade and colour, is so great, that if you only follow her closely, every one who
looks at your drawing with attention will think that you have been inventing the most artifically
and unnaturally delightful interchanges of shadow that could possibly be devised by human wit.

You will find this law of interchange insisted upon at length by Prout in his "Lessons on Light
and Shade:" it seems, of all his principles of composition, to be the one he is most conscious
of; many others he obeys by instinct, but this he formally accepts and forcibly declares.

The typical purpose of the law of interchange is, of course, to teach us how opposite natures
may be helped and strengthened by receiving each, as far as they can, some impress or imparted
power, from the other.

8. THE LAW OF CONSISTENCY.

It is to be remembered, in the next place, that while contrast exhibits the characters of things,
it very often neutralises or paralyses their power. A number of white things may be shown to
be clearly white by opposition of a black thing, but if you want the full power of their gathered
light, the black thing may be seriously in our way. Thus, while contrast displays things, it
is unity and sympathy which employ them, concentrating the power of several into a mass. And,
not in art merely, but in all the affairs of life, the wisdom of man is continually called
upon to reconcile these opposite methods of exhibiting, or using, the materials in his power.
By change he gives them pleasantness, and by consistency value; by change he is refreshed,
and by perseverence strengthened.

Hence many compositions address themselves to the spectator by aggregate force of colour or
line, more than by contrasts of either; many noble pictures are painted almost exclusively
in various tones of red, or grey, or gold, so as to be instantly striking by their breadth
of flush, or glow, or tender coldness, these qualities being exhibited only by slight and subtle
use of contrast. Similarly as to form; some compositions associate massive and rugged forms,
others slight and graceful ones, each with few interruptions by lines of contrary character.
And, in general, such compositions possess higher sublimity than those which are more mingled
in their elements. They tell a special tale, and summon a definite state of feeling, while
the grand compositions merely please the eye.

This unity or breadth of character generally attaches most to the works of the greatest men;
their separate pictures have all separate aims. We have not, in each, grey colour set against
sombre, and sharp forms against soft, and loud passages against low; but we have the bright
picture, with its delicate sadness; the sombre picture, with its single ray of relief; the
stern picture, with only one tender group of lines; the soft and calm picture, with only one
rock angle at its flank; and so on. Hence the variety of their work, as well as its impressiveness.
The principal bearing of this law, however, is on the separate masses or divisions of a picture:
the character of the whole composition may be broken or various, if we please, but there must
certainly be a tendency to consistent assemblage in its divisions. As an army may act on several
points at once, but can only act effectually by having somewhere formed and regular masses,
and not wholly by skirmishers; so a picture may be various in its tendencies, but must be somewhere
united and coherent in its masses. Good composers are always associating their colours in great
groups; binding their forms together by encompassing lines, and securing, by various dexterities
of expedient, what they themselves call "breadth:" that is to say, a large gathering of each
kind of thing into one place; light being gathered to light, darkness to darkness, and colour
to colour. If, however, this be done by introducing false lights or false colours, it is absurd
and monstrous; the skill of a painter consists in obtaining breadth by rational arrangement
of his objects, not by forced or wanton treatment of them. It is an easy matter to paint one
thing all white, and another all black or brown; but not an easy matter to assemble all the
circumstances which will naturally produce white in one place, and brown in another. Generally
speaking, however, breadth will result in sufficient degree from fidelity of study: Nature
is always broad; and if you paint her colours in true relations, you will paint them in majestic
masses. If you find your work look broken and scattered, it is, in all probability, not only
ill composed, but untrue.

The opposite quality to breadth, that of division or scattering of light and colour, has a
certain contrasting charm, and is occasionally introduced with exquisite effect by good composers.[261]
Still, it is never the mere scattering, but the order discernible through this scattering,
which is the real source of pleasure; not the mere multitude, but the constellation of multitude.
The broken lights in the work of a good painter wander like flocks upon the hills, not unshepherded;
speaking of life and peace: the broken lights of a bad painter fall like hailstones, and are
capable only of mischief, leaving it to be wished they were also of dissolution.

9. THE LAW OF HARMONY.

This last law is not, strictly speaking, so much one of composition as of truth, but it must
guide composition, and is properly, therefore, to be stated in this place.

Good drawing is, as we have seen, an abstract of natural facts; you cannot represent all that
you would, but must continually be falling short, whether you will or no, of the force, or
quantity, of Nature. Now, suppose that your means and time do not admit of your giving the
depth of colour in the scene, and that you are obliged to paint it paler. If you paint all
the colours proportionately paler, as if an equal quantity of tint had been washed away from
each of them, you still obtain a harmonious, though not an equally forcible statement of natural
fact. But if you take away the colours unequally, and leave some tints nearly as deep as they
are in Nature, while others are much subdued, you have no longer a true statement. You cannot
say to the observer, "Fancy all those colours a little deeper, and you will have the actual
fact." However he adds in imagination, or takes away, something is sure to be still wrong.
The picture is out of harmony.

It will happen, however, much more frequently, that you have to darken the whole system of
colours, than to make them paler. You remember, in your first studies of colour from Nature,
you were to leave the passages of light which were too bright to be imitated, as white paper.
But, in completing the picture, it becomes necessary to put colour into them; and then the
other colours must be made darker, in some fixed relation to them. If you deepen all proportionately,
though the whole scene is darker than reality, it is only as if you were looking at the reality
in a lower light: but if, while you darken some of the tints, you leave others undarkened,
the picture is out of harmony, and will not give the impression of truth.

It is not, indeed, possible to deepen all the colours so much as to relieve the lights in their
natural degree; you would merely sink most of your colours, if you tried to do so, into a broad
mass of blackness: but it is quite possible to lower them harmoniously, and yet more in some
parts of the picture than in others, so as to allow you to show the light you want in a visible
relief. In well-harmonised pictures this is done by gradually deepening the tone of the picture
towards the lighter parts of it, without materially lowering it in the very dark parts; the
tendency in such pictures being, of course, to include large masses of middle tints. But the
principal point to be observed in doing this, is to deepen the individual tints without dirtying
or obscuring them. It is easy to lower the tone of the picture by washing it over with grey
or brown; and easy to see the effect of the landscape, when its colours are thus universally
polluted with black, by using the black convex mirror, one of the most pestilent inventions
for falsifying nature and degrading art which ever was put into an artist's hand.[262] For
the thing required is not to darken pale yellow by mixing grey with it, but to deepen the pure
yellow; not to darken crimson by mixing black with it, but by making it deeper and richer crimson:
and thus the required effect could only be seen in Nature, if you had pieces of glass of the
colour of every object in your landscape, and of every minor hue that made up those colours,
and then could see the real landscape through this deep gorgeousness of the varied glass. You
cannot do this with glass, but you can do it for yourself as you work; that is to say, you
can put deep blue for pale blue, deep gold for pale gold, and so on, in the proportion you
need; and then you may paint as forcibly as you choose, but your work will still be in the
manner of Titian, not of Caravaggio or Spagnoletto, or any other of the black slaves of painting.[263]

Supposing those scales of colour, which I told you to prepare in order to show you the relations
of colour to grey, were quite accurately made, and numerous enough, you would have nothing
more to do, in order to obtain a deeper tone in any given mass of colour, than to substitute
for each of its hues the hue as many degrees deeper in the scale as you wanted, that is to
say, if you want to deepen the whole two degrees, substituting for the yellow No. 5. the yellow
No. 7., and for the red No. 9. the red No. 11., and so on; but the hues of any object in Nature
are far too numerous, and their degrees too subtle, to admit of so mechanical a process. Still,
you may see the principle of the whole matter clearly by taking a group of colours out of your
scale, arranging them prettily, and then washing them all over with grey: that represents the
treatment of Nature by the black mirror. Then arrange the same group of colours, with the tints
five or six degrees deeper in the scale; and that will represent the treatment of Nature by Titian.

You can only, however, feel your way fully to the right of the thing by working from Nature.

The best subject on which to begin a piece of study of this kind is a good thick tree trunk,
seen against blue sky with some white clouds in it. Paint the clouds in true and tenderly gradated
white; then give the sky a bold full blue, bringing them well out; then paint the trunk and
leaves grandly dark against all, but in such glowing dark green and brown as you see they will
bear. Afterwards proceed to more complicated studies, matching the colours carefully first
by your old method; then deepening each colour with its own tint, and being careful, above
all things, to keep truth of equal change when the colours are connected with each other, as
in dark and light sides of the same object. Much more aspect and sense of harmony are gained
by the precision with which you observe the relation of colours in dark sides and light sides,
and the influence of modifying reflections, than by mere accuracy of added depth in independent
colours.

This harmony of tone, as it is generally called, is the most important of those which the artist
has to regard. But there are all kinds of harmonies in a picture, according to its mode of
production. There is even a harmony of touch. If you paint one part of it very rapidly and
forcibly, and another part slowly and delicately, each division of the picture may be right
separately, but they will not agree together: the whole will be effectless and valueless, out
of harmony. Similarly, if you paint one part of it by a yellow light in a warm day, and another
by a grey light in a cold day, though both may have been sunlight, and both may be well toned,
and have their relative shadows truly cast, neither will look like light: they will destroy
each other's power, by being out of harmony. These are only broad and definable instances of
discordance; but there is an extent of harmony in all good work much too subtle for definition;
depending on the draughtsman's carrying everything he draws up to just the balancing and harmonious
point, in finish, and colour, and depth of tone, and intensity of moral feeling, and style
of touch, all considered at once; and never allowing himself to lean too emphatically on detached
parts, or exalt one thing at the expense of another, or feel acutely in one place and coldly
in another. If you have got some of Cruikshank's etchings, you will be able, I think, to feel
the nature of harmonious treatment in a simple kind, by comparing them with any of Richter's
illustrations to the numerous German story-books lately published at Christmas, with all the
German stories spoiled. Cruikshank's work is often incomplete in character and poor in incident,
but, as drawing, it is perfect in harmony. The pure and simple effects of daylight which he
gets by his thorough mastery of treatment in this respect, are quite unrivalled, as far as
I know, by any other work executed with so few touches. His vignettes to Grimm's German stories,
already recommended, are the most remarkable in this quality. Richter's illustrations, on the
contrary, are of a very high stamp as respects understanding of human character, with infinite
playfulness and tenderness of fancy; but, as drawings, they are almost unendurably out of harmony,
violent blacks in one place being continually opposed to trenchant white in another; and, as
is almost sure to be the case with bad harmonists, the local colour hardly felt anywhere. All
German work is apt to be out of harmony, in consequence of its too frequent conditions of affectation,
and its wilful refusals of fact; as well as by reason of a feverish kind of excitement, which
dwells violently on particular points, and makes all the lines of thought in the picture to
stand on end, as it were, like a cat's fur electrified; while good work is always as quiet
as a couchant leopard, and as strong.

I have now stated to you all the laws of composition which occur to me as capable of being
illustrated or defined; but there are multitudes of others which, in the present state of my
knowledge, I cannot define, and others which I never hope to define; and these the most important,
and connected with the deepest powers of the art. Among those which I hope to be able to explain
when I have thought of them more, are the laws which relate to nobleness and ignobleness; that
ignobleness especially which we commonly call "vulgarity," and which, in its essence, is one
of the most curious subjects of inquiry connected with human feeling. Among those which I never
hope to explain, are chiefly laws of expression, and others bearing simply on simple matters;
but, for that very reason, more influential than any others. These are, from the first, as
inexplicable as our bodily sensations are; it being just as impossible, I think, to explain
why one succession of musical notes[264] shall be noble and pathetic, and such as might have
been sung by Casella to Dante, and why another succession is base and ridiculous, and would
be fit only for the reasonably good ear of Bottom, as to explain why we like sweetness, and
dislike bitterness. The best part of every great work is always inexplicable: it is good because
it is good; and innocently gracious, opening as the green of the earth, or falling as the dew
of heaven.

But though you cannot explain them, you may always render yourself more and more sensitive
to these higher qualities by the discipline which you generally give to your character, and
this especially with regard to the choice of incidents; a kind of composition in some sort
easier than the artistical arrangements of lines and colours, but in every sort nobler, because
addressed to deeper feelings.

For instance, in the "Datur Hora Quieti," the last vignette to Roger's Poems, the plough in
the foreground has three purposes. The first purpose is to meet the stream of sunlight on the
river, and make it brighter by opposition; but any dark object whatever would have done this.
Its second purpose is by its two arms, to repeat the cadence of the group of the two ships,
and thus give a greater expression of repose; but two sitting figures would have done this.
Its third and chief, or pathetic, purpose is, as it lies abandoned in the furrow (the vessels
also being moored, and having their sails down), to be a type of human labour closed with the
close of day. The parts of it on which the hand leans are brought most clearly into sight;
and they are the chief dark of the picture, because the tillage of the ground is required of
man as a punishment; but they make the soft light of the setting sun brighter, because rest
is sweetest after toil. These thoughts may never occur to us as we glance carelessly at the
design; and yet their under current assuredly affects the feelings, and increases, as the painter
meant it should, the impression of melancholy, and of peace.

Again, in the "Lancaster Sands," which is one of the plates I have marked as most desirable
for your possession; the stream of light which falls from the setting sun on the advancing
tide stands similarly in need of some force of near object to relieve its brightness. But the
incident which Turner has here adopted is the swoop of an angry seagull at a dog, who yelps
at it, drawing back as the wave rises over his feet, and the bird shrieks within a foot of
his face. Its unexpected boldness is a type of the anger of its ocean element, and warns us
of the sea's advance just as surely as the abandoned plough told us of the ceased labour of
the day.

It is not, however, so much in the selection of single incidents of this kind as in the feeling
which regulates the arrangement of the whole subject that the mind of a great composer is known.
A single incident may be suggested by a felicitous chance, as a pretty motto might be for the
heading of a chapter. But the great composers so arrange all their designs that one incident
illustrates another, just as one colour relieves another. Perhaps the "Heysham," of the Yorkshire
series which, as to its locality, may be considered a companion to the last drawing we have
spoken of, the "Lancaster Sands," presents as interesting an example as we could find of Turner's
feeling in this respect. The subject is a simple north-country village, on the shore of Morecambe
Bay; not in the common sense, a picturesque village: there are no pretty bow-windows, or red
roofs, or rocky steps of entrance to the rustic doors, or quaint gables; nothing but a single
street of thatched and chiefly clay-built cottages, ranged in a somewhat monotonous line, the
roofs so green with moss that at first we hardly discern the houses from the fields and trees.
The village street is closed at the end by a wooden gate, indicating the little traffic there
is on the road through it, and giving it something the look of a large farmstead, in which
a right of way lies through the yard. The road which leads to this gate is full of ruts, and
winds down a bad bit of hill between two broken banks of moor ground, succeeding immediately
to the few enclosures which surround the village; they can hardly be called gardens; but a
decayed fragment or two of fencing fill the gaps in the bank; and a clothes-line, with some
clothes on it, striped blue and red, and a smock-frock, is stretched between the trunks of
some stunted willows; a very small haystack and pigstye being seen at the back of the cottage
beyond. An empty, two-wheeled, lumbering cart, drawn by a pair of horses with huge wooden collars,
the driver sitting lazily in the sun, sideways on the leader, is going slowly home along the
rough road, it being about country dinner-time. At the end of the village there is a better
house, with three chimneys and a dormer window in its roof, and the roof is of stone shingle
instead of thatch, but very rough. This house is no doubt the clergyman's; there is some smoke
from one of its chimneys, none from any other in the village; this smoke is from the lowest
chimney at the back, evidently that of the kitchen, and it is rather thick, the fire not having
been long lighted. A few hundred yards from the clergyman's house, nearer the shore, is the
church, discernible from the cottage only by its low-arched belfry, a little neater than one
would expect in such a village; perhaps lately built by the Puseyite incumbent;[265] and beyond
the church, close to the sea, are two fragments of a border war-tower, standing on their circular
mound, worn on its brow deep into edges and furrows by the feet of the village children. On
the bank of moor, which forms the foreground, are a few cows, the carter's dog barking at a
vixenish one: the milkmaid is feeding another, a gentle white one, which turns its head to
her, expectant of a handful of fresh hay, which she has brought for it in her blue apron, fastened
up round her waist; she stands with her pail on her head, evidently the village coquette, for
she has a neat bodice, and pretty striped petticoat under the blue apron, and red stockings.
Nearer us, the cowherd, barefooted, stands on a piece of the limestone rock (for the ground
is thistly and not pleasurable to bare feet);--whether boy or girl we are not sure; it may
be a boy, with a girl's worn-out bonnet on, or a girl with a pair of ragged trowsers on; probably
the first, as the old bonnet is evidently useful to keep the sun out of our eyes when we are
looking for strayed cows among the moorland hollows, and helps us at present to watch (holding
the bonnet's edge down) the quarrel of the vixenish cow with the dog, which, leaning on our
long stick, we allow to proceed without any interference. A little to the right the hay is
being got in, of which the milkmaid has just taken her apronful to the white cow; but the hay
is very thin, and cannot well be raked up because of the rocks; we must glean it like corn,
hence the smallness of our stack behind the willows, and a woman is pressing a bundle of it
hard together, kneeling against the rock's edge, to carry it safely to the hay-cart without
dropping any. Beyond the village is a rocky hill, deep set with brushwood, a square crag or
two of limestone emerging here and there, with pleasant turf on their brows, heaved in russet
and mossy mounds against the sky, which, clear and calm, and as golden as the moss, stretches
down behind it towards the sea. A single cottage just shows its roof over the edge of the hill,
looking seaward; perhaps one of the village shepherds is a sea captain now, and may have built
it there, that his mother may first see the sails of his ship whenever it runs into the bay.
Then under the hill, and beyond the border tower, is the blue sea itself, the waves flowing
in over the sand in long curved lines, slowly; shadows of cloud and gleams of shallow water
on white sand alternating--miles away; but no sail is visible, not one fisherboat on the beach,
not one dark speck on the quiet horizon. Beyond all are the Cumberland mountains, clear in
the sun, with rosy light on all their crags.

I should think the reader cannot but feel the kind of harmony there is in this composition;
the entire purpose of the painter to give us the impression of wild, yet gentle, country life,
monotonous as the succession of the noiseless waves, patient and enduring as the rocks; but
peaceful, and full of health and quiet hope, and sanctified by the pure mountain air and baptismal
dew of heaven, falling softly between days of toil and nights of innocence.

All noble composition of this kind can be reached only by instinct: you cannot set yourself
to arrange such a subject; you may see it, and seize it, at all times, but never laboriously
invent it. And your power of discerning what is best in expression, among natural subjects,
depends wholly on the temper in which you keep your own mind; above all, on your living so
much alone as to allow it to become acutely sensitive in its own stillness. The noisy life
of modern days is wholly incompatible with any true perception of natural beauty. If you go
down into Cumberland by the railroad, live in some frequented hotel, and explore the hills
with merry companions, however much you may enjoy your tour or their conversation, depend upon
it you will never choose so much as one pictorial subject rightly; you will not see into the
depth of any. But take knapsack and stick, walk towards the hills by short day's journeys--ten
or twelve miles a day--taking a week from some starting-place sixty or seventy miles away:
sleep at the pretty little wayside inns, or the rough village ones; then take the hills as
they tempt you, following glen or shore as your eye glances or your heart guides, wholly scornful
of local fame or fashion, and of everything which it is the ordinary traveller's duty to see
or pride to do. Never force yourself to admire anything when you are not in the humour; but
never force yourself away from what you feel to be lovely, in search of anything better: and
gradually the deeper scenes of the natural world will unfold themselves to you in still increasing
fulness of passionate power; and your difficulty will be no more to seek or to compose subjects,
but only to choose one from among the multitude of melodious thoughts with which you will be
haunted, thoughts which will of course be noble or original in proportion to your own depth
of character and general power of mind: for it is not so much by the consideration you give
to any single drawing, as by the previous discipline of your powers of thought, that the character
of your composition will be determined. Simplicity of life will make you sensitive to the refinement
and modesty of scenery, just as inordinate excitement and pomp of daily life will make you
enjoy coarse colours and affected forms. Habits of patient comparison and accurate judgment
will make your art precious, as they will make your actions wise; and every increase of noble
enthusiasm in your living spirit will be measured by the reflection of its light upon the works
of your hands.

    Faithfully yours,

    J. RUSKIN.

FOOTNOTES:

[234] I give Rossetti this preëminence, because, though the leading Pre-Raphaelites have all
about equal power over colour in the abstract, Rossetti and Holman Hunt are distinguished above
the rest for rendering colour under effects of light; and of these two, Rossetti composes with
richer fancy and with a deeper sense of beauty, Hunt's stern realism leading him continually
into harshness. Rossetti's carelessness, to do him justice, is only in water-colour, never in oil.

[235] All the degradation of art which was brought about, after the rise of the Dutch school,
by asphaltum, yellow varnish, and brown trees, would have been prevented, if only painters
had been forced to work in dead colour. Any colour will do for some people, if it is browned
and shining; but fallacy in dead colour is detected on the instant. I even believe that whenever
a painter begins to wish that he could touch any portion of his work with gum, he is going wrong.

It is necessary, however, in this matter, carefully to distinguish between translucency and
lustre. Translucency, though, as I have said above, a dangerous temptation, is, in its place,
beautiful; but lustre, or shininess, is always, in painting, a defect. Nay, one of my best
painter-friends (the "best" being understood to attach to both divisions of that awkward compound
word), tried the other day to persuade me thatlustre was an ignobleness in anything; and it
was only the fear of treason to ladies' eyes, and to mountain streams, and to morning dew,
which kept me from yielding the point to him. One is apt always to generalise too quickly in
such matters; but there can be no question that lustre is destructive of loveliness in colour,
as it is of intelligibility in form. Whatever may be the pride of a young beauty in the knowledge
that her eyes shine (though perhaps even eyes are most beautiful in dimness), she would be
sorry if her cheeks did; and which of us would wish to polish a rose?

[236] But not shiny or greasy. Bristol board, or hot-pressed imperial, or grey paper that feels
slightly adhesive to the hand, is best. Coarse, gritty, and sandy papers are fit only for blotters
and blunderers; no good draughtsman would lay a line on them. Turner worked much on a thin
tough paper, dead in surface; rolling up his sketches in tight bundles that would go deep into
his pockets.

[237] I insist upon this unalterability of colour the more because I address you as a beginner,
or an amateur; a great artist can sometimes get out of a difficulty with credit, or repent
without confession. Yet even Titian's alterations usually show as stains on his work.

[238] It is, I think, a piece of affectation to try to work with few colours; it saves time
to have enough tints prepared without mixing, and you may at once allow yourself these twenty-four.
If you arrange them in your colour-box in the order I have set them down, you will always easily
put your finger on the one you want.

  Cobalt.         Smalt.                Antwerp blue.   Prussian blue.
  Black.          Gamboge.              Emerald green.  Hooker's green.
  Lemon yellow.   Cadmium yellow.       Yellow ochre.   Roman ochre.
  Raw sienna.     Burnt sienna.         Light red.      Indian red.
  Mars orange.    Ext't of vermilion.   Carmine.        Violet carmine.
  Brown madder.   Burnt umber.          Vandyke brown.  Sepia.

Antwerp blue and Prussian blue are not very permanent colours, but you need not care much about
permanence in your own work as yet, and they are both beautiful; while Indigo is marked by
Field as more fugitive still, and is very ugly. Hooker's green is a mixed colour, put in the
box merely to save you loss of time in mixing gamboge and Prussian blue. No. 1. is the best
tint of it. Violet carmine is a noble colour for laying broken shadows with, to be worked into
afterwards with other colours.

If you wish to take up colouring seriously, you had better get Field's "Chromatography" at
once; only do not attend to anything it says about principles or harmonies of colour; but only
to its statements of practical serviceableness in pigments, and of their operations on each
other when mixed, &c.

[239] A more methodical, though, under general circumstances, uselessly prolix way, is to cut
a square hole, some half an inch wide, in the sheet of cardboard, and a series of small circular
holes in a slip of cardboard an inch wide. Pass the slip over the square opening, and match
each colour beside one of the circular openings. You will thus have no occasion to wash any
of the colours away. But the first rough method is generally all you want, as after a little
practice, you only need to look at the hue through the opening in order to be able to transfer
it to your drawing at once.

[240] If colours were twenty times as costly as they are, we should have many more good painters.
If I were Chancellor of the Exchequer I would lay a tax of twenty shillings a cake on all colours
except black, Prussian blue, Vandyke brown, and Chinese white, which I would leave for students.
I don't say this jestingly; I believe such a tax would do more to advance real art than a great
many schools of design.

[241] I say modern, because Titian's quiet way of blending colours, which is the perfectly
right one, is not understood now by any artist. The best colour we reach is got by stippling;
but this not quite right.

[242] The worst general character that colour can possibly have is a prevalent tendency to
a dirty yellowish green, like that of a decaying heap of vegetables; this colour is accurately
indicative of decline or paralysis in missal-painting.

[243] That is to say, local colour inherent in the object. The gradations of colour in the
various shadows belonging to various lights exhibit form, and therefore no one but a colourist
can ever draw forms perfectly (see "Modern Painters," vol. iv. chap. iii. at the end); but
all notions of explaining form by superimposed colour, as in architectural mouldings, are absurd.
Colour adorns form, but does not interpret it. An apple is prettier, because it is striped,
but it does not look a bit rounder; and a cheek is prettier because it is flushed, but you
would see the form of the cheek bone better if it were not. Colour may, indeed, detach one
shape from another, as in grounding a bas-relief, but it always diminishes the appearance of
projection, and whether you put blue, purple, red, yellow, or green, for your ground, the bas-relief
will be just as clearly or just as imperfectly relieved, as long as the colours are of equal
depth. The blue ground will not retire the hundredth part of an inch more than the red one.

[244] See, however, at the close of this letter, the notice of one more point connected with
the management of colour, under the head "Law of Harmony."

[245] See farther, on this subject, "Modern Painters," vol. iv. chap. viii § 6.

[246] "In general, throughout Nature, reflection and repetition are peaceful things, associated
with the idea of quiet succession in events, that one day should be like another day, or one
history the repetition of another history, being more or less results of quietness, while dissimilarity
and non-succession are results of interference and disquietude. Thus, though an echo actually
increases the quantity of sound heard, its repetition of the note or syllable gives an idea
of calmness attainable in no other way; hence also the feeling of calm given to a landscape
by the voice of a cuckoo."

[247] This is obscure in the rude woodcut, the masts being so delicate that they are confused
among the lines of reflection. In the original they have orange light upon them, relieved against
purple behind.

[248] The cost of art in getting a bridge level is always lost, for you must get up to the
height of the central arch at any rate, and you only can make the whole bridge level by putting
the hill farther back, and pretending to have got rid of it when you have not, but have only
wasted money in building an unnecessary embankment. Of course, the bridge should not be difficultly
or dangerously steep, but the necessary slope, whatever it may be, should be in the bridge
itself, as far as the bridge can take it, and not pushed aside into the approach, as in our
Waterloo road; the only rational excuse for doing which is that when the slope must be long
it is inconvenient to put on a drag at the top of the bridge, and that any restiveness of the
horse is more dangerous on the bridge than on the embankment. To this I answer: first, it is
not more dangerous in reality, though it looks so, for the bridge is always guarded by an effective
parapet, but the embankment is sure to have no parapet, or only a useless rail; and secondly,
that it is better to have the slope on the bridge, and make the roadway wide in proportion,
so as to be quite safe, because a little waste of space on the river is no loss, but your wide
embankment at the side loses good ground; and so my picturesque bridges are right as well as
beautiful, and I hope to see them built again some day, instead of the frightful straight-backed
things which we fancy are fine, and accept from the pontifical rigidities of the engineering mind.

[249] I cannot waste space here by reprinting what I have said in other books: but the reader
ought, if possible, to refer to the notices of this part of our subject in "Modern Painters,"
vol. iv. chap. xviii., and "Stones of Venice," vol. iii. chap. i. § 8.

[250] If you happen to be reading at this part of the book, without having gone through any
previous practice, turn back to the sketch of the ramification of stone pine, Fig. 4. page
30., and examine the curves of its boughs one by one, trying them by the conditions here stated
under the heads A. and B.

[251] The reader, I hope, observes always that every line in these figures is itself one of
varying curvature, and cannot be drawn by compasses.

[252] I hope the reader understands that these woodcuts are merely facsimiles of the sketches
I make at the side of my paper to illustrate my meaning as I write--often sadly scrawled if
I want to get on to something else. This one is really a little too careless; but it would
take more time and trouble to make a proper drawing of so odd a boat than the matter is worth.
It will answer the purpose well enough as it is.

[253] Imperfect vegetable form I consider that which is in its nature dependent, as in runners
and climbers; or which is susceptible of continual injury without materially losing the power
of giving pleasure by its aspect, as in the case of the smaller grasses. I have not, of course,
space here to explain these minor distinctions, but the laws above stated apply to all the
more important trees and shrubs likely to be familiar to the student.

[254] There is a very tender lesson of this kind in the shadows of leaves upon the ground;
shadows which are the most likely of all to attract attention, by their pretty play and change.
If you examine them, you will find that the shadows do not take the forms of the leaves, but
that, through each interstice, the light falls, at a little distance, in the form of a round
or oval spot; that is to say, it produces the image of the sun itself, cast either vertically
or obliquely, in circle or ellipse according to the slope of the ground. Of course the sun's
rays produce the same effect, when they fall through any small aperture: but the openings between
leaves are the only ones likely to show it to an ordinary observer, or to attract his attention
to it by its frequency, and lead him to think what this type may signify respecting the greater
Sun; and how it may show us that, even when the opening through which the earth receives light
is too small to let us see the Sun himself, the ray of light that enters, if it comes straight
from Him, will still bear with it His image.

[255] In the smaller figure (32.), it will be seen that this interruption is caused by a cart
coming down to the water's edge; and this object is serviceable as beginning another system
of curves leading out of the picture on the right, but so obscurely drawn as not to be easily
represented in outline. As it is unnecessary to the explanation of our point here, it has been
omitted in the larger diagram, the direction of the curve it begins being indicated by the
dashes only.

[256] Both in the Sketches in Flanders and Germany.

[257] If you happen to meet with the plate of Durer's representing a coat of arms with a skull
in the shield, note the value given to the concave curves and sharp point of the helmet by
the convex leafage carried round it in front; and the use of the blank white part of the shield
in opposing the rich folds of the dress.

[258] Turner hardly ever, as far as I remember, allows a strong light to oppose a full dark,
without some intervening tint. His suns never set behind dark mountains without a film of cloud
above the mountain's edge.

[259]

    "A prudent chief not always must display
    His powers in equal ranks and fair array,
    But with the occasion and the place comply,
    Conceal his force; nay, seem sometimes to fly.
    Those oft are stratagems which errors seem,
    Nor is it Homer nods, but we that dream."

Essay on Criticism.

[260] I am describing from a MS., circa 1300, of Gregory's "Decretalia" in my own possession.

[261] One of the most wonderful compositions of Tintoret in Venice, is little more than a field
of subdued crimson, spotted with flakes of scattered gold. The upper clouds in the most beautiful
skies owe great part of their power to infinitude of division; order being marked through this
division.

[262] I fully believe that the strange grey gloom, accompanied by considerable power of effect,
which prevails in modern French art must be owing to the use of this mischievous instrument;
the French landscape always gives me the idea of Nature seen carelessly in the dark mirror,
and painted coarsely, but scientifically, through the veil of its perversion.

[263] Various other parts of this subject are entered into, especially in their bearing on
the ideal of painting, in "Modern Painters," vol. iv. chap. iii.

[264] In all the best arrangements of colour, the delight occasioned by their mode of succession
is entirely inexplicable, nor can it be reasoned about; we like it just as we like an air in
music, but cannot reason any refractory person into liking it, if they do not: and yet there
is distinctly a right and a wrong in it, and a good taste and bad taste respecting it, as also
in music.

[265] "Puseyism" was unknown in the days when this drawing was made; but the kindly and helpful
influences of what may be called ecclesiastical sentiment, which, in a morbidly exaggerated
condition, forms one of the principal elements of "Puseyism,"--I use this word regretfully,
no other existing which will serve for it,--had been known and felt in our wild northern districts
long before.

APPENDIX.

THINGS TO BE STUDIED.

The worst danger by far, to which a solitary student is exposed, is that of liking things that
he should not. It is not so much his difficulties, as his tastes, which he must set himself
to conquer; and although, under the guidance of a master, many works of art may be made instructive,
which are only of partial excellence (the good and bad of them being duly distinguished), his
safeguard, as long as he studies alone, will be in allowing himself to possess only things,
in their way, so free from faults, that nothing he copies in them can seriously mislead him,
and to contemplate only those works of art which he knows to be either perfect or noble in
their errors. I will therefore set down in clear order, the names of the masters whom you may
safely admire, and a few of the books which you may safely possess. In these days of cheap
illustration, the danger is always rather of your possessing too much than too little. It may
admit of some question, how far the looking at bad art may set off and illustrate the characters
of the good; but, on the whole, I believe it is best to live always on quite wholesome food,
and that our taste of it will not be made more acute by feeding, however temporarily, on ashes.
Of course the works of the great masters can only be serviceable to the student after he has
made considerable progress himself. It only wastes the time and dulls the feelings of young
persons, to drag them through picture galleries; at least, unless they themselves wish to look
at particular pictures. Generally, young people only care to enter a picture gallery when there
is a chance of getting leave to run a race to the other end of it; and they had better do that
in the garden below. If, however, they have any real enjoyment of pictures, and want to look
at this one or that, the principal point is never to disturb them in looking at what interests
them, and never to make them look at what does not. Nothing is of the least use to young people
(nor, by the way, of much use to old ones), but what interests them; and therefore, though
it is of great importance to put nothing but good art into their possession, yet when they
are passing through great houses or galleries, they should be allowed to look precisely at
what pleases them: if it is not useful to them as art, it will be in some other way: and the
healthiest way in which art can interest them is when they look at it, not as art, but because
it represents something they like in nature. If a boy has had his heart filled by the life
of some great man, and goes up thirstily to a Vandyck portrait of him, to see what he was like,
that is the wholesomest way in which he can begin the study of portraiture; if he love mountains,
and dwell on a Turner drawing because he sees in it a likeness to a Yorkshire scar, or an Alpine
pass, that is the wholesomest way in which he can begin the study of landscape; and if a girl's
mind is filled with dreams of angels and saints, and she pauses before an Angelico because
she thinks it must surely be indeed like heaven, that is the wholesomest way for her to begin
the study of religious art.

When, however, the student has made some definite progress, and every picture becomes really
a guide to him, false or true, in his own work, it is of great importance that he should never
so much as look at bad art; and then, if the reader is willing to trust me in the matter, the
following advice will be useful to him. In which, with his permission, I will quit the indirect
and return to the epistolary address, as being the more convenient.

First, in Galleries of Pictures:

1. You may look, with trust in their being always right, at Titian, Veronese, Tintoret, Giorgione,
John Bellini, and Velasquez; the authenticity of the picture being of course established for
you by proper authority.

2. You may look with admiration, admitting, however question of right and wrong,[266] at Van
Eyck, Holbein, Perugino, Francia, Angelico, Leonardo da Vinci, Correggio, Vandyck, Rembrandt,
Reynolds, Gainsborough, Turner, and the modern Pre-Raphaelites.[267] You had better look at
no other painters than these, for you run a chance, otherwise, of being led far off the road,
or into grievous faults, by some of the other great ones, as Michael Angelo, Raphael, and Rubens;
and of being, besides, corrupted in taste by the base ones, as Murillo, Salvator, Claude, Gasper
Poussin, Teniers, and such others. You may look, however, for examples of evil, with safe universality
of reprobation, being sure that everything you see is bad, at Domenichino, the Caracci, Bronzino,
and the figure pieces of Salvator.

Among those named for study under question, you cannot look too much at, nor grow too enthusiastically
fond of, Angelico, Correggio, Reynolds, Turner, and the Pre-Raphaelites; but, if you find yourself
getting especially fond of any of the others, leave off looking at them, for you must be going
wrong some way or other. If, for instance, you begin to like Rembrandt or Leonardo especially,
you are losing your feeling for colour; if you like Van Eyck or Perugino especially, you must
be getting too fond of rigid detail; and if you like Vandyck or Gainsborough especially, you
must be too much attracted by gentlemanly flimsiness.

Secondly, of published, or otherwise multiplied, art, such as you may be able to get yourself,
or to see at private houses or in shops, the works of the following masters are the most desirable,
after the Turners, Rembrandts, and Durers, which I have asked you to get first:

1. Samuel Prout.

All his published lithographic sketches are of the greatest value, wholly unrivalled in power
of composition, and in love and feeling of architectural subject. His somewhat mannered linear
execution, though not to be imitated in your own sketches from Nature, may be occasionally
copied, for discipline's sake, with great advantage; it will give you a peculiar steadiness
of hand, not quickly attainable in any other way; and there is no fear of your getting into
any faultful mannerism as long as you carry out the different modes of more delicate study
above recommended.

If you are interested in architecture, and wish to make it your chief study, you should draw
much from photographs of it; and then from the architecture itself, with the same completion
of detail and gradation, only keeping the shadows of due paleness, in photographs they are
always about four times as dark as they ought to be; and treat buildings with as much care
and love as artists do their rock foregrounds, drawing all the moss and weeds, and stains upon
them. But if, without caring to understand architecture, you merely want the picturesque character
of it, and to be able to sketch it fast, you cannot do better than take Prout for your exclusive
master; only do not think that you are copying Prout by drawing straight lines with dots at
the end of them. Get first his "Rhine," and draw the subjects that have most hills, and least
architecture in them, with chalk on smooth paper, till you can lay on his broad flat tints,
and get his gradations of light, which are very wonderful; then take up the architectural subjects
in the "Rhine," and draw again and again the groups of figures, &c., in his "Microcosm," and
"Lessons on Light and Shadow." After that, proceed to copy the grand subjects in the sketches
in "Flanders and Germany;" or in "Switzerland and Italy," if you cannot get the Flanders; but
the Switzerland is very far inferior. Then work from Nature, not trying to Proutise Nature,
by breaking smooth buildings into rough ones, but only drawing what you see, with Prout's simple
method and firm lines. Don't copy his coloured works. They are good, but not at all equal to
his chalk and pencil drawings, and you will become a mere imitator, and a very feeble imitator,
if you use colour at all in Prout's method. I have not space to explain why this is so, it
would take a long piece of reasoning; trust me for the statement.

2. John Lewis.

His sketches in Spain, lithographed by himself, are very valuable. Get them, if you can, and
also some engravings (about eight or ten, I think, altogether) of wild beasts, executed by
his own hand a long time ago; they are very precious in every way. The series of the "Alhambra"
is rather slight, and few of the subjects are lithographed by himself; still it is well worth
having.

But let no lithographic work come into the house, if you can help it, nor even look at any,
except Prout's, and those sketches of Lewis's.

3. George Cruikshank.

If you ever happen to meet with the two volumes of "Grimm's German Stories," which were illustrated
by him long ago, pounce upon them instantly; the etchings in them are the finest things, next
to Rembrandt's, that, as far as I know, have been done since etching was invented. You cannot
look at them too much, nor copy them too often.

All his works are very valuable, though disagreeable when they touch on the worst vulgarities
of modern life; and often much spoiled by a curiously mistaken type of face, divided so as
to give too much to the mouth and eyes, and leave too little for forehead, the eyes being set
about two thirds up, instead of at half the height of the head. But his manner of work is always
right; and his tragic power, though rarely developed, and warped by habits of caricature, is,
in reality, as great as his grotesque power.

There is no fear of his hurting your taste, as long as your principal work lies among art of
so totally different a character as most of that which I have recommended to you; and you may,
therefore, get great good by copying almost anything of his that may come in your way; except
only his illustrations lately published to "Cinderella," and "Jack and the Beanstalk," and
"Tom Thumb," which are much over-laboured, and confused in line. You should get them, but do
not copy them.

4. Alfred Rethel.

I only know two publications by him; one, the "Dance of Death," with text by Reinick, published
in Leipsic, but to be had now of any London bookseller for the sum, I believe, of eighteen
pence, and containing six plates full of instructive character; the other, of two plates only,
"Death the Avenger," and "Death the Friend." These two are far superior to the "Todtentanz,"
and, if you can get them, will be enough in themselves, to show all that Rethel can teach you.
If you dislike ghastly subjects, get "Death the Friend" only.

5. Bewick.

The execution of the plumage in Bewick's birds is the most masterly thing ever yet done in
wood-cutting; it is just worked as Paul Veronese would have worked in wood, had he taken to
it. His vignettes, though too coarse in execution, and vulgar in types of form, to be good
copies, show, nevertheless, intellectual power of the highest order; and there are pieces of
sentiment in them, either pathetic or satirical, which have never since been equalled in illustrations
of this simple kind; the bitter intensity of the feeling being just like that which characterises
some of the leading Pre-Raphaelites. Bewick is the Burns of painting.

6. Blake.

The "Book of Job," engraved by himself, is of the highest rank in certain characters of imagination
and expression; in the mode of obtaining certain effects of light it will also be a very useful
example to you. In expressing conditions of glaring and flickering light, Blake is greater
than Rembrandt.

7. Richter.

I have already told you what to guard against in looking at his works. I am a little doubtful
whether I have done well in including them in this catalogue at all; but the fancies in them
are so pretty and numberless, that I must risk, for their sake, the chance of hurting you a
little in judgment of style. If you want to make presents of story-books to children, his are
the best you can now get.

8. Rossetti.

An edition of Tennyson, lately published, contains woodcuts from drawings by Rossetti and other
chief Pre-Raphaelite masters. They are terribly spoiled in the cutting, and generally the best
part, the expression of feature, entirely lost;[268] still they are full of instruction, and
cannot be studied too closely. But observe, respecting these woodcuts, that if you have been
in the habit of looking at much spurious work, in which sentiment, action, and style are borrowed
or artificial, you will assuredly be offended at first by all genuine work, which is intense
in feeling. Genuine art, which is merely art, such as Veronese's or Titian's, may not offend
you, though the chances are that you will not care about it: but genuine works of feeling,
such as Maude and Aurora Leigh in poetry, or the grand Pre-Raphaelite designs in painting,
are sure to offend you; and if you cease to work hard, and persist in looking at vicious and
false art, they will continue to offend you. It will be well, therefore, to have one type of
entirely false art, in order to know what to guard against. Flaxman's outlines to Dante contain,
I think, examples of almost every kind of falsehood and feebleness which it is possible for
a trained artist, not base in thought, to commit or admit, both in design and execution. Base
or degraded choice of subject, such as you will constantly find in Teniers and others of the
Dutch painters, I need not, I hope, warn you against; you will simply turn away from it in
disgust; while mere bad or feeble drawing, which makes mistakes in every direction at once,
cannot teach you the particular sort of educated fallacy in question. But, in these designs
of Flaxman's, you have gentlemanly feeling, and fair knowledge of anatomy, and firm setting
down of lines, all applied in the foolishest and worst possible way; you cannot have a more
finished example of learned error, amiable want of meaning, and bad drawing with a steady hand.[269]
Retsch's outlines have more real material in them than Flaxman's, occasionally showing true
fancy and power; in artistic principle they are nearly as bad, and in taste worse. All outlines
from statuary, as given in works on classical art, will be very hurtful to you if you in the
least like them; and nearly all finished line engravings. Some particular prints I could name
which possess instructive qualities, but it would take too long to distinguish them, and the
best way is to avoid line engravings of figures altogether. If you happen to be a rich person,
possessing quantities of them, and if you are fond of the large finished prints from Raphael,
Correggio, &c., it is wholly impossible that you can make any progress in knowledge of real
art till you have sold them all--or burnt them, which would be a greater benefit to the world.
I hope that some day, true and noble engravings will be made from the few pictures of the great
schools, which the restorations undertaken by the modern managers of foreign galleries may
leave us; but the existing engravings have nothing whatever in common with the good in the
works they profess to represent, and if you like them, you like in the originals of them hardly
anything but their errors.

Finally, your judgment will be, of course, much affected by your taste in literature. Indeed,
I know many persons who have the purest taste in literature, and yet false taste in art, and
it is a phenomenon which puzzles me not a little: but I have never known any one with false
taste in books, and true taste in pictures. It is also of the greatest importance to you, not
only for art's sake, but for all kinds of sake, in these days of book deluge, to keep out of
the salt swamps of literature, and live on a rocky island of your own, with a spring and a
lake in it, pure and good. I cannot, of course, suggest the choice of your library to you,
every several mind needs different books; but there are some books which we all need, and assuredly,
if you read Homer,[270] Plato, Æschylus, Herodotus, Dante,[271] Shakspeare, and Spenser, as
much as you ought, you will not require wide enlargement of shelves to right and left of them
for purposes of perpetual study. Among modern books, avoid generally magazine and review literature.
Sometimes it may contain a useful abridgement or a wholesome piece of criticism; but the chances
are ten to one it will either waste your time or mislead you. If you want to understand any
subject whatever, read the best book upon it you can hear of; not a review of the book. If
you don't like the first book you try, seek for another; but do not hope ever to understand
the subject without pains, by a reviewer's help. Avoid especially that class of literature
which has a knowing tone; it is the most poisonous of all. Every good book, or piece of book,
is full of admiration and awe; it may contain firm assertion or stern satire, but it never
sneers coldly, nor asserts haughtily, and it always leads you to reverence or love something
with your whole heart. It is not always easy to distinguish the satire of the venomous race
of books from the satire of the noble and pure ones; but in general you may notice that the
cold-blooded Crustacean and Batrachian books will sneer at sentiment; and the warm-blooded,
human books, at sin. Then, in general, the more you can restrain your serious reading to reflective
or lyric poetry, history, and natural history, avoiding fiction and the drama, the healthier
your mind will become. Of modern poetry keep to Scott, Wordsworth, Keats, Crabbe, Tennyson,
the two Brownings, Lowell, Longfellow, and Coventry Patmore, whose "Angel in the House" is
a most finished piece of writing, and the sweetest analysis we possess of quiet modern domestic
feeling; while Mrs. Browning's "Aurora Leigh" is, as far as I know, the greatest poem which
the century has produced in any language. Cast Coleridge at once aside, as sickly and useless;
and Shelley as shallow and verbose; Byron, until your taste is fully formed, and you are able
to discern the magnificence in him from the wrong. Never read bad or common poetry, nor write
any poetry yourself; there is, perhaps, rather too much than too little in the world already.

Of reflective prose, read chiefly Bacon, Johnson, and Helps. Carlyle is hardly to be named
as a writer for "beginners," because his teaching, though to some of us vitally necessary,
may to others be hurtful. If you understand and like him, read him; if he offends you, you
are not yet ready for him, and perhaps may never be so; at all events, give him up, as you
would sea-bathing if you found it hurt you, till you are stronger. Of fiction, read Sir Charles
Grandison, Scott's novels, Miss Edgeworth's, and, if you are a young lady, Madame de Genlis',
the French Miss Edgeworth; making these, I mean, your constant companions. Of course you must,
or will read other books for amusement, once or twice; but you will find that these have an
element of perpetuity in them, existing in nothing else of their kind: while their peculiar
quietness and repose of manner will also be of the greatest value in teaching you to feel the
same characters in art. Read little at a time, trying to feel interest in little things, and
reading not so much for the sake of the story as to get acquainted with the pleasant people
into whose company these writers bring you. A common book will often give you much amusement,
but it is only a noble book which will give you dear friends. Remember also that it is of less
importance to you in your earlier years, that the books you read should be clever, than that
they should be right. I do not mean oppressively or repulsively instructive; but that the thoughts
they express should be just, and the feelings they excite generous. It is not necessary for
you to read the wittiest or the most suggestive books: it is better, in general, to hear what
is already known, and may be simply said. Much of the literature of the present day, though
good to be read by persons of ripe age, has a tendency to agitate rather than confirm, and
leaves its readers too frequently in a helpless or hopeless indignation, the worst possible
state into which the mind of youth can be thrown. It may, indeed, become necessary for you,
as you advance in life, to set your hand to things that need to be altered in the world, or
apply your heart chiefly to what must be pitied in it, or condemned; but, for a young person,
the safest temper is one of reverence, and the safest place one of obscurity. Certainly at
present, and perhaps through all your life, your teachers are wisest when they make you content
in quiet virtue, and that literature and art are best for you which point out, in common life
and familiar things, the objects for hopeful labour, and for humble love.

FOOTNOTES:

[266] I do not mean necessarily to imply inferiority of rank, in saying that this second class
of painters have questionable qualities. The greatest men have often many faults, and sometimes
their faults are a part of their greatness; but such men are not, of course, to be looked upon
by the student with absolute implicitness of faith.

[267] Including under this term, John Lewis, and William Hunt of the Old Water-colour, who,
take him all in all, is the best painter of still life, I believe, that ever existed.

[268] This is especially the case in the St. Cecily, Rossetti's first illustration to the "palace
of art," which would have been the best in the book had it been well engraved. The whole work
should be taken up again, and done by line engraving, perfectly; and wholly from Pre-Raphaelite
designs, with which no other modern work can bear the least comparison.

[269] The praise I have given incidentally to Flaxman's sculpture in the "Seven Lamps," and
elsewhere, refers wholly to his studies from Nature, and simple groups in marble, which were
always good and interesting. Still, I have overrated him, even in this respect; and it is generally
to be remembered that, in speaking of artists whose works I cannot be supposed to have specially
studied, the errors I fall into will always be on the side of praise. For, of course, praise
is most likely to be given when the thing praised is above one's knowledge; and, therefore,
as our knowledge increases, such things may be found less praiseworthy than we thought. But
blame can only be justly given when the thing blamed is below one's level of sight; and, practically,
I never do blame anything until I have got well past it, and am certain that there is demonstrable
falsehood in it. I believe, therefore, all my blame to be wholly trustworthy, having never
yet had occasion to repent of one depreciatory word that I have ever written, while I have
often found that, with respect to things I had not time to study closely, I was led too far
by sudden admiration, helped, perhaps, by peculiar associations, or other deceptive accidents;
and this the more, because I never care to check an expression of delight, thinking the chances
are, that, even if mistaken, it will do more good than harm; but I weigh every word of blame
with scrupulous caution. I have sometimes erased a strong passage of blame from second editions
of my books; but this was only when I found it offended the reader without convincing him,
never because I repented of it myself.

[270] Chapman's, if not the original.

[271] Carey's or Cayley's, if not the original. I do not know which are the best translations
of Plato. Herodotus and Æschylus can only be read in the original. It may seem strange that
I name books like these for "beginners:" but all the greatest books contain food for all ages;
and an intelligent and rightly bred youth or girl ought to enjoy much, even in Plato, by the
time they are fifteen or sixteen.
